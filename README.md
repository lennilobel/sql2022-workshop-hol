# Hands-On Lab Setup: SQL Server 2022 and Development Tools

Welcome!

Before diving into the hands-on labs, ensure you have the necessary software and databases installed. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **SQL Server 2022**: The Developer Edition of SQL Server 2022 is required for this lab. It's free for development and testing, not for production, and includes all the features of SQL Server 2022. Download and install it from [Microsoft's SQL Server Downloads page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).

2. **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: To interact with SQL Server, including running queries and managing databases, install the latest version of SSMS. This ensures compatibility with SQL Server 2022 and supports features like Always Encrypted that may not be supported in older SSMS verions. Download SSMS from [here](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup).

3. **Visual Studio 2022**: Some demos, especially those involving Always Encrypted, require Visual Studio 2022. The Community Edition is free for students, open-source contributors, and individuals. Download it from [Visual Studio's Community Edition page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

4. **AdventureWorks2019 Database**: Many demos utilize the AdventureWorks2019 sample database. Install it by restoring the `AdventureWorks2019.bak` file available on [Microsoft's documentation page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms).

5. **Wide World Importers Database**: One demo uses the Wide World Importers sample database. Install it by restoring the `WideWorldImporters-Full.bak` file found on the [GitHub releases page for SQL Server samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0).

Follow these setups carefully to ensure a smooth experience with the hands-on labs.

All set? Let's get started!
