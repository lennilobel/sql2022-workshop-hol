# T-SQL Enhancements

In this section, you will learn all the major T-SQL enhancements introduced in SQL Server 2022. These include brand new T-SQL functions, as well as enhancements to several existing T-SQL functions.

Labs in this section cover the following T-SQL enhancements:

- **DATE_BUCKET**: Returns the date corresponding to the start of each bucket.

- **DATETRUNC**: Return a datetime truncated to any part.

- **LEAST and GREATEST**: Returns the minimum or maximum value across columns.

- **STRING_SPLIT ordinal**: Returns the ordinal of each split element.

- **GENERATE_SERIES**: Generates a number series resultset.

- **TRIM enhancements**: Provides greater control over leading and trailing characters to trim.

- **IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM**: Provids a NULL-safe equality check.

- **Windowing enhancements**: SELECT…WINDOW, and FIRST_VALUE/LAST_VALUE enhancements.

- **Bit functions**: Bit masking and bit manipulation.

The labs in this section are independent of one another, so it is not necessary to work through every one of them. You can choose to work through these labs in any order you prefer, focusing on those that interest you more first, and them exploring the others later.
