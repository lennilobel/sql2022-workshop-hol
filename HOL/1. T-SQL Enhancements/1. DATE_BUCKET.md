# DATE_BUCKET Function

SQL Server 2022 introduces the `DATE_BUCKET` function, enhancing the way we can aggregate and analyze data over time. Below, we'll explore how to use this function to create various day-level buckets.

Start by clicking the `New Query` button on the toolbar at the top of the SSMS window to open a new query window.

## Two-day Bucket

Group data into two-day intervals, starting from a specified "origin" date. This approach helps in analyzing data trends over every two days. Copy and paste the following code into the new query window in SSMS:

```sql
DECLARE @Origin date = '2022-01-01'
SELECT
    '1/2d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 2, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-01'), @Origin),
    '2/2d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 2, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-02'), @Origin),
    '1/2d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 2, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-03'), @Origin),
    '2/2d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 2, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-04'), @Origin),
    '1/2d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 2, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-05'), @Origin),
    '2/2d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 2, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-06'), @Origin),
    '1/2d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 2, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-07'), @Origin),
    '2/2d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 2, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-08'), @Origin)
```

This code demonstrates grouping dates into two-day buckets. The bucket number alternates between '1/2d' and '2/2d', indicating the division of days into two-day periods based on the provided origin date.

## Adjusting the Origin Date

Now run the same code with a different origin date. Change the `@Origin` variable assignment as follows, and the re-ru the code snippet:

```sql
DECLARE @Origin date = '2021-12-31'
```
Shifting the origin date backwards by a day changes how dates are allocated into two-day buckets. You can observe this from the output, where the first row now actually represents the second day of a two day bucket that starts on the last day of the previous year. This flexibility allows for tailored data analysis based on the starting point of the bucketing interval.

## Three-day Bucket

Extend the bucketing concept to three-day intervals for more extensive data aggregation, as demonstrated by running the following code snippet:

```sql
DECLARE @Origin date = '2022-01-01'
SELECT
    '1/3d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-01'), @Origin),
    '2/3d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-02'), @Origin),
    '3/3d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-03'), @Origin),
    '1/3d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-04'), @Origin),
    '2/3d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-05'), @Origin),
    '3/3d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-06'), @Origin),
    '1/3d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-07'), @Origin),
    '2/3d' = DATE_BUCKET(DAY, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-08'), @Origin)
```
By grouping dates into three-day intervals, we can observe patterns or trends over slightly longer periods, providing a broader analysis window than two-day buckets. This method could be particularly useful for datasets where changes occur over several days rather than from one day to the next.

Let's continue with the detailed breakdown, starting with a one-week bucketand moving through to the three-month bucket.

## One-week Bucket

Now let's group dates into one-week intervals, demonstrating the use of `DATE_BUCKET` for weekly data analysis:

```sql
DECLARE @Origin date = '2022-01-01'
SELECT
    '1/1w' = DATE_BUCKET(WEEK, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-01'), @Origin),
    '2/1w' = DATE_BUCKET(WEEK, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-02'), @Origin),
    '3/1w' = DATE_BUCKET(WEEK, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-03'), @Origin),
    '4/1w' = DATE_BUCKET(WEEK, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-04'), @Origin),
    '5/1w' = DATE_BUCKET(WEEK, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-05'), @Origin),
    '6/1w' = DATE_BUCKET(WEEK, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-06'), @Origin),
    '7/1w' = DATE_BUCKET(WEEK, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-07'), @Origin),
    '1/1w' = DATE_BUCKET(WEEK, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-08'), @Origin)
```
This example shows how `DATE_BUCKET` can effectively group dates by week, providing a clear way to analyze data on a weekly basis. The output demonstrates the assignment of each day to its respective week number relative to the `@Origin`.

## One-month Bucket

Now group dates into one-month intervals using `DATE_BUCKET`, ideal for monthly data aggregation and trend analysis.

```sql
DECLARE @Origin date = '2022-01-01'
SELECT
    'Jan/1m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-15'), @Origin),
    'Feb/1m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-02-20'), @Origin),
    'Mar/1m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-03-13'), @Origin),
    'Apr/1m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-04-01'), @Origin),
    'May/1m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-05-23'), @Origin),
    'Jun/1m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-06-30'), @Origin),
    'Jul/1m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-07-15'), @Origin),
    'Aug/1m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 1, CONVERT(date, '2022-08-30'), @Origin)
```
This snippet demonstrates the utility of `DATE_BUCKET` in monthly data grouping. By specifying a month interval, it aligns each date within its respective month bucket (that is, it returns the first date of each month), helpful for monthly reporting or analysis.

## Three-month Bucket

Now we'll use `DATE_BUCKET` to group dates into three-month (quarterly) intervals, aiding in quarterly data analysis.

```sql
DECLARE @Origin date = '2022-01-01'
SELECT
    'Jan/3m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-01-15'), @Origin),
    'Feb/3m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-02-20'), @Origin),
    'Mar/3m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-03-13'), @Origin),
    'Apr/3m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-04-01'), @Origin),
    'May/3m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-05-23'), @Origin),
    'Jun/3m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-06-30'), @Origin),
    'Jul/3m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-07-15'), @Origin),
    'Aug/3m' = DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 3, CONVERT(date, '2022-08-30'), @Origin)
```

Let's proceed with additional `DATE_BUCKET` examples, to simplify week boundary calculations and analyze data with quarter-width buckets.

## Simplify Week Boundary Calculations

**Objective:** Compare traditional methods for calculating week boundaries with the streamlined approach offered by `DATE_BUCKET`.

**Before Using DATE_BUCKET:**
This requires a complex method to determine the previous Saturday based on the current date, involving conditional logic and calculations like so:

```sql
DECLARE @Today date = GETDATE()
DECLARE @PreviousSaturday date = DATEADD(DAY, - (DATEPART(WEEKDAY, @Today) + @@DATEFIRST) % 7, @Today)
SELECT @PreviousSaturday
```

This approach requires understanding of how SQL Server's `DATEPART` and `@@DATEFIRST` settings influence the calculation, making it less intuitive and harder to maintain.

**After Using DATE_BUCKET:**
A more straightforward method using `DATE_BUCKET` to find the beginning of the current or previous week, anchored to a known Saturday (for example, 2/24/2024).

```sql
SELECT DATE_BUCKET
(
    WEEK,                       -- week-sized buckets
    1,                          -- where each bucket is one week
    CAST(GETDATE() AS date),    -- get the start of today's bucket
    DATEFROMPARTS(2024, 2, 24)  -- where the origin (e.g., 2024-02-24) is any Saturday
)
```

This example highlights the ease of using `DATE_BUCKET` to calculate week boundaries by simply specifying the bucket size and a reference Saturday date as the origin.

## Querying with Quarter-width Buckets

**Objective:** Leverage `DATE_BUCKET` for more granular analysis within a dataset, particularly focusing on quarterly data aggregation.

**Using AdventureWorks2019 Database:**
A practical application of `DATE_BUCKET` to segment sales order due dates into quarters, facilitating analysis of sales patterns over quarterly periods.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2019

-- Get the DueDate bucket based on quarter-width buckets
SELECT
    SalesOrderID,
    OrderDate,
    DueDate,
    DueDateQuarterNumber = DATEPART(QUARTER, DueDate),                                          -- The quarter without the year
    DueDateQuarterBucketDate = DATE_BUCKET(QUARTER, 1, DueDate),                                -- The quarter of each year
    DueDateQuarterBucketDayIndex = DATEDIFF(DAY, DATE_BUCKET(QUARTER, 1, DueDate), DueDate),    -- How many days into the quarter
    SalesOrderNumber,
    PurchaseOrderNumber,
    AccountNumber
FROM
    Sales.SalesOrderHeader
ORDER BY
    DueDate
```

This SQL query demonstrates the `DATE_BUCKET` function's capabilities. Here's a breakdown of how each column in the query adds to our understanding of the date data:

- **DueDateQuarterNumber**: Utilizes the `DATEPART` function to identify the quarter of the `DueDate`. This method reveals the quarter number (1-4) but omits the year.

- **DueDateQuarterBucketDate**: Applies the `DATE_BUCKET` function to categorize `DueDate` into specific quarters of the year, effectively aligning dates with the quarters they belong to, including the year. This function transforms dates into their corresponding quarter beginnings (1/1, 4/1, 7/1, 10/1) for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively, so you can track not only the quarter, but the year of each quarter.

- **DueDateQuarterBucketDayIndex**: Uses the `DATEDIFF` function in conjunction with `DATE_BUCKET` to calculate the number of days each `DueDate` falls into its quarter. This is done by comparing each `DueDate` with the start date of its quarter bucket, offering insight into how far into the quarter a date is.

Scroll through the results to observe the values in these three columns across the entire table.
