# Welcome!

Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of SQL Server, where you are about to dive deep into some of its most powerful and sophisticated features for developers. Through a series of carefully crafted hands-on labs, you will explore a variety of capabilities, including both longstanding functionalities and new enhancements introduced in SQL Server 2022.

From mastering the intricacies of T-SQL enhancements and understanding the dynamic nature of temporal tables to securing your data with cutting-edge security features like ledger technology, Dynamic Data Masking (DDM), Row-Level Security (RLS), and the Always Encrypted functionality, these labs are designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience. Each lab has been meticulously prepared to guide you through the practical application of these features, ensuring that you gain the confidence and knowledge needed to implement them in real-world scenarios.

Most of the labs you'll engage with involve a practical, hands-on approach where you'll open a new query window in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and either copy/paste code from the prepared lab content or type out code snippets yourself. You'll start with a single snippet, and as the lab progresses, you'll add new snippets to the bottom of your script. This methodical build-up allows you to construct a full script step by step, providing a clear understanding of how each part contributes to the whole, enhancing both learning and retention.

But remember, learning is not just about acquiring new skills—it's also about having fun and enjoying the process! These labs are your playground for experimentation, offering you the chance to explore, make mistakes, and discover solutions firsthand. So, embrace this opportunity with enthusiasm and curiosity, and let's embark on this educational adventure together. By the end of this journey, you'll not only have a deeper understanding of SQL Server's developer features but also a greater appreciation for the art of database management and security. Let the learning—and the fun—begin!
