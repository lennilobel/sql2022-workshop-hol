# Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves

Secure enclaves represent an advanced feature of Always Encrypted introduced in SQL Sever 2019 and enhanced in SQL Server 2022, aimed at overcoming some of the limitations of its basic implementation introduced in SQL Server 2016. While our previous labs have not covered this topic hands-on due to its complexity, understanding secure enclaves is crucial for realizing the full potential of Always Encrypted in SQL Server.

## What Are Secure Enclaves?

A secure enclave is a protected region of memory within the SQL Server process, designed to perform computations on encrypted data. This secure area ensures that data and the operations performed on it are protected from the rest of the system, including SQL Server itself. The use of secure enclaves extends the capabilities of Always Encrypted by allowing more complex operations to be securely performed on encrypted data.

## The Embassy Analogy

Imagine a secure enclave as an embassy located in a foreign country. Being inside the embassy is akin to being in the territory of the country that owns the embassy, surrounded by a protected environment. Stepping out of the embassy places you in the foreign country's jurisdiction — potentially hostile territory. However, the enclave (or embassy) allows for secure operations (or safe haven) within the foreign environment without the need to travel back to the home country. Comparatively, traveling thousands of miles represents the high latency incurred by data having to round-trip between the client and the server for encryption or decryption operations. The secure enclave, thus, acts as "a piece of the client on the server machine," eliminating the need for extensive network round-trips and significantly enhancing data operation efficiency.

## Additional Security Measures of Secure Enclaves

Crucially, the server machine, even the kernel on the server machine, has no access to the region of memory designated as the secure enclave. This strict isolation ensures that even the most privileged processes on the server cannot view or interfere with the operations within the enclave. Furthermore, in the event of a system crash, the contents of the enclave are not revealed in crash dumps, safeguarding the confidentiality of sensitive operations and data within the enclave.

## Overcoming Limitations of Basic Always Encrypted

The primary implementation of Always Encrypted, as explored in our labs, encrypts data within client applications before sending it to the database. This approach, while secure, limits the types of operations that can be performed on encrypted columns. For example, it supports exact matches on deterministically encrypted data but cannot handle queries that require pattern matching or range comparisons on encrypted columns.

## Key Benefits of Secure Enclaves

Secure enclaves address these limitations by enabling:

- **In-Place Encryption and Decryption:** Data can be encrypted or decrypted directly within the enclave, akin to stepping into the embassy to conduct sensitive operations securely.
  
- **Advanced Query Capabilities:** With secure enclaves, SQL Server can perform operations on randomly encrypted data that were previously not possible, such as range queries, wildcard matching, and pattern matching. This is achieved by securely decrypting the data inside the enclave, performing the operation, and then re-encrypting the result if necessary.

- **Delegated Cryptography Operations:** The query processor can delegate portions of the query that require cryptographic operations to the enclave, allowing for complex queries on encrypted data while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data.

## Trust Establishment via Attestation Server

For a client to trust a secure enclave, an attestation process is required, akin to verifying the authenticity and safety of an embassy before stepping inside. This involves an attestation server, which verifies the identity and integrity of the secure enclave before allowing the client to perform cryptographic operations within it. Once trust is established, the client can provide the enclave with the CMK via a secure tunnel, enabling secure operations directly on the server without the need for high-latency network traffic.

## Setting Up an Environment with Secure Enclaves

Implementing Always Encrypted with secure enclaves requires a specific setup involving a database server configured to use Always Encrypted with secure enclaves and an attestation server to establish trust. For more detailed information on setting up an environment that leverages Always Encrypted with secure enclaves, refer to the official Microsoft documentation:
