# Always Encrypted in Client Applications

In this lab, we transition from directly interacting with SQL Server to incorporating Always Encrypted into a real-world application scenario. You will develop a C# client application designed to interface with the `Employee` table we populated in the first lab.

We'll explore how Always Encrypted functions within the context of a client application, focusing on key operations such as inserting and querying data in the `Employee` table. A significant aspect of this lab involves the use of stored procedures. You'll learn how to create stored procedures that are compatible with Always Encrypted, ensuring that your application can insert new employee records and query existing ones while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.

## Create the Stored Procedures

Let's start by creating stored procedures for our client application to call. These procedures enable secure data operations within our database, interfacing directly with encrypted columns.

In SSMS, return to the same query window you were working with in the previous lab.

**Stored Procedure for Selecting Employees by SSN**

Execute the following code to create the `SelectEmployeesBySSN` stored procedure:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectEmployeesBySSN
    @SSN varchar(20)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT
        EmployeeId,
        Name,
        SSN,
        Salary,
        City
    FROM
        Employee
    WHERE
        SSN = @SSN
END
```

**Stored Procedure for Inserting a New Employee**

Execute the following code to create the `InsertCustomer` stored procedure:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE InsertCustomer
    @Name varchar(20),
    @SSN varchar(20),
    @Salary money,
    @City varchar(20)
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Employee (Name, SSN, Salary, City)
     VALUES (@Name, @SSN, @Salary, @City)
END
```

**Parameter Binding and Encryption**

- **SelectEmployeesBySSN:** When the `@SSN` parameter is used, SQL Server recognizes its direct correlation with the encrypted `SSN` column in the `Employee` table. This connection enables the ADO.NET provider to automatically encrypt the parameter value using the correct encryption type and key before it's sent in a query, ensuring the operation adheres to the security constraints defined by Always Encrypted.

- **InsertCustomer:** Similarly, for the `InsertCustomer` stored procedure, SQL Server understands the relationship between the `@Name`, `@SSN`, `@Salary`, and `@City` parameters and their corresponding columns in the `Employee` table. Given that `SSN` and `Salary` are encrypted columns, the server conveys to the client-side provider that the `@SSN` and `@Salary` parameters need to be encrypted according to their designated column encryption settings before the insert operation. The `@Name` and `@City` parameters, associated with non-encrypted columns, can be sent as plain text.

This parameter binding plays a key role in Always Encrypted's architecture, ensuring that data remains encrypted in transit and at rest, and can only be decrypted by authorized client applications. It highlights the seamless and secure data flow between the client application and SQL Server, facilitated by stored procedures that respect and integrate with the encryption schema of the database. Through this approach, developers can maintain data confidentiality and integrity without the need for manual encryption or decryption processes, leaning on SQL Server and the ADO.NET provider to handle these complexities.

## Create the Client Application

Create a C# console application named `AEClient` to interact with the SQL Server database using Always Encrypted. This application will demonstrate how to insert and query encrypted data in the `Employee` table through ADO.NET, first using direct table access like we did in the last lab, and then by calling the stored procedures we just created.

Here's how to set up the application:

1. **Start Visual Studio**: Launch Visual Studio and create a new project. Choose "C# Console Application" as the project type and name it "AEClient". Accept the default framework and click Create.

2. **Add NuGet Package**: Once your project is created, you'll need to add the `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` package to connect to SQL Server. To do this, go to Solution Explorer, right-click on "Dependencies" > "Manage NuGet Packages". In the NuGet Package Manager, click the Browse tab, search for `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`, select it, and click "Install".

3. **Program.cs Code**: Replace the existing code in `Program.cs` with the following code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data;
using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient;

namespace AEClient
{
    internal class Program
    {
        private const string ConnStr =
            "data source=.;initial catalog=MyEncryptedDB;integrated security=true;trust server certificate=true;";

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            using var conn = new SqlConnection(ConnStr);
            conn.Open();

            // Placeholder for database operations

            conn.Close();
        }

    }
}
```

This code sets up a connection to the database using a connection string that does not yet include the `column encryption setting=enabled` setting that's required for Always Encrypted to work.

Throughout the rest of this lab, we'll experiment with Always Encrypted by replacing the `Main` method to test out different use cases.

## Retrieve Encrypted Data

Replace the `Main` method with the following code:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    using var conn = new SqlConnection(ConnStr);
    conn.Open();

    using var cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Employee", conn);

    using var rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
    while (rdr.Read())
    {
        Console.WriteLine("EmployeeId: {0}; Name: {1}; SSN: {2}; Salary: {3}; City: {4}",
            rdr["EmployeeId"], rdr["Name"], rdr["SSN"], rdr["Salary"], rdr["City"]);
    }
    rdr.Close();

    conn.Close();
}
```

This code queries the `Employee` table and displays the column values of each employee row. Run the project, and observe:

- **Encrypted Data Presentation:** For the `SSN` and `Salary` columns, which are encrypted in the database, the application displays their contents as byte arrays. This representation signifies that the data for these columns is being returned in its encrypted form. The reason is simple: even with access to the CMK, without `column encryption setting=enabled` in the connection string, the SQL client does not attempt to decrypt the data automatically.

- **Visible Data for Unencrypted Columns:** The `EmployeeId`, `Name`, and `City` columns are not encrypted, and display their actual (plaintext) values.

To view the decrypted data for the `SSN` and `Salarray` columns, we simply need to update the connection string to include the `column encryption setting=enabled` directive. This change instructs the ADO.NET client to automatically decrypt data retrieved from encrypted columns, provided it has access to the necessary Column Master Key (CMK). Recall from the previous lab that we have access to the CMK located in the certificate store on our machine.

Update the `ConnStr` constant above the `Main` method as follows:

```csharp
private const string ConnStr =
    "data source=.;initial catalog=MyEncryptedDB;integrated security=true;trust server certificate=true;column encryption setting=enabled;";
```

All we've done is append `column encryption setting=enabled` to the same connection string we had originally defined.

Now run the project again. This time, instead of retrieving encrypted data as byte arrays, you will now see the actual decrypted values for the `SSN` and `Salary` columns, demonstrating the seamless integration of Always Encrypted with client applications.

## Query on Encrypted Data

Now replace the `Main` method in your `AEClient` application with the following code:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    using var conn = new SqlConnection(ConnStr);
    conn.Open();

    using var cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE SSN IN (@SSN1, @SSN2)", conn);

    var ssn1parm = new SqlParameter("@SSN1", SqlDbType.VarChar, 20) { Value = "987-65-4321" };
    cmd.Parameters.Add(ssn1parm);

    var ssn2parm = new SqlParameter("@SSN2", SqlDbType.VarChar, 20) { Value = "246-80-1357" };
    cmd.Parameters.Add(ssn2parm);

    using var rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
    while (rdr.Read())
    {
        Console.WriteLine("EmployeeId: {0}; Name: {1}; SSN: {2}; Salary: {3}; City: {4}",
            rdr["EmployeeId"], rdr["Name"], rdr["SSN"], rdr["Salary"], rdr["City"]);
    }
    rdr.Close();

    conn.Close();
}
```

This code executes a parameterized query that searches for employees based on their Social Security Numbers (SSNs). Because the `SSN` column uses deterministic encryption, encrypted values of the SSN are consistent for identical plaintext values. This consistency allows SQL Server to perform equality and `IN` clause operations on encrypted data.

When the application executes this parameterized query, the ADO.NET client encrypts the parameter values `@SSN1` and `@SSN2` client-side. The encrypted parameters are then sent to SQL Server, which can directly compare these encrypted values against the deterministically encrypted data in the `SSN` column.

Run the application, and observe that the two specified employees are correctly retrieved from the database. This outcome confirms the successful matching of encrypted parameter values against the encrypted `SSN` column values stored in the database.

Of course, this cannot be expected to work with the `Salary` column, because it uses randomized encryption. To see this, replace the `Main` method as follows:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    using var conn = new SqlConnection(ConnStr);
    conn.Open();

    using var cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE Salary = @Salary", conn);
    var parm = new SqlParameter("@Salary", SqlDbType.VarChar, 20) { Value = "Doug Nichols" };
    cmd.Parameters.Add(parm);

    using var rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
    while (rdr.Read())
    {
        Console.WriteLine("EmployeeId: {0}; Name: {1}; SSN: {2}; Salary: {3}; City: {4}",
            rdr["EmployeeId"], rdr["Name"], rdr["SSN"], rdr["Salary"], rdr["City"]);
    }
    rdr.Close();
    conn.Close();
}
```

Running this code results in an exception because SQL Server can't compare the encrypted parameter with the encrypted `Salary` column in the database for equality. Randomized encryption ensures high security by encrypting the same data into different ciphertexts, preventing SQL Server from performing direct comparisons.

## Insert Encrypted Data

Now let's try inserting a new employee with encrypted data. Stop execution and replace the `Main` method with the following code:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
	using var conn = new SqlConnection(ConnStr);
	conn.Open();

	using var cmd = new SqlCommand("INSERT INTO Employee VALUES(@Name, @SSN, @Salary, @City)", conn);

	var nameParam = new SqlParameter("@Name", SqlDbType.VarChar, 20) { Value = "Steven Jacobs" };
	cmd.Parameters.Add(nameParam);

	var ssnParam = new SqlParameter("@SSN", SqlDbType.VarChar, 20) { Value = "333-22-4444" };
	cmd.Parameters.Add(ssnParam);

	var salaryParam = new SqlParameter("@Salary", SqlDbType.Money) { Value = 57006 };
	cmd.Parameters.Add(salaryParam);

	var cityParam = new SqlParameter("@City", SqlDbType.VarChar, 20) { Value = "Denver" };
	cmd.Parameters.Add(cityParam);

	cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
	Console.WriteLine("Successfully inserted new row with encrypted data");

	conn.Close();
}
```

This inserts a new employee into the `Employee` table, with encrypted values for its `SSN` and `Salary` columns.

- **Parameterized SQL Command:** The `INSERT` command is parameterized, including `@Name`, `@SSN`, `@Salary`, and `@City` parameters corresponding to the columns in the `Employee` table. This ensures that input values are securely handled.

- **Client-Side Encryption:** For the `SSN` and `Salary` columns, which are set up with Always Encrypted, the ADO.NET client-side library automatically encrypts the parameter values based on the encryption type and keys defined in SQL Server. This encryption occurs before the data is sent over the network.

- **Insert Operation:** The command executes an `INSERT` operation, adding a new row to the `Employee` table. The encrypted data for `SSN` and `Salary` ensures that sensitive information remains protected both in transit and at rest in the database.

## Call the Stored Procedures

To wrap things up, let's call the stored procedures that we created at the start of this lab. First let's look at `SelectEmployeesBySSN`. Replace the `Main` method as follows:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    using var conn = new SqlConnection(ConnStr);
    conn.Open();

    using var cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
    cmd.CommandText = "SelectEmployeesBySSN";
    cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;

    cmd.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@SSN", SqlDbType.VarChar, 20) { Value = "246-80-1357" });

    using var rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
    while (rdr.Read())
    {
        var customerId = rdr["EmployeeId"];
        var name = rdr["Name"];
        var ssn = rdr["SSN"];
        var city = rdr["City"];

        Console.WriteLine("EmployeeId: {0}; Name: {1}; SSN: {2}; City: {3}",
            customerId, name, ssn, city);
    }
    rdr.Close();

    conn.Close();
}
```

**Understanding the Stored Procedure Call:**

- **CommandText and CommandType:** The `CommandText` property of the `SqlCommand` object is set to the name of the stored procedure, `SelectEmployeesBySSN`. This tells the command which stored procedure to execute. The `CommandType` is set to `CommandType.StoredProcedure`, differentiating this command from a direct T-SQL statement and indicating that `CommandText` refers to a stored procedure.

- **Parameterization and Encryption:** The `@SSN` parameter is added to the command with the value "246-80-1357". Because the stored procedure uses this parameter on the `SSN` column, and the `SSN` column in the database is encrypted using Always Encrypted, SQL Server instructs the client to deterministically encrypt this parameter value client-side, using the correct encryption key. This ensures that the encrypted parameter can be correctly compared against the deterministically encrypted `SSN` column in the database.

Run the application and observe the output. The stored procedure successfully retrieves and displays the employee with the SSN "246-80-1357", even though this value is encrypted in the database. Furthermore, the `SSN` and `Salary` columns in the query results are also decrypted and displayed in clear text.

Finally, let's call the `InsertCustomer` stored procedure. Replace the `Main` method one last time, as follows:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    using var conn = new SqlConnection(ConnStr);
    conn.Open();

    using var cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
    cmd.CommandText = "InsertCustomer";
    cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;

    cmd.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@Name", SqlDbType.VarChar, 20) { Value = "Marcy Jones" });
    cmd.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@SSN", SqlDbType.VarChar, 20) { Value = "888-88-8888" });
    cmd.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@Salary", SqlDbType.Money) { Value = 45365 });
    cmd.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@City", SqlDbType.VarChar, 20) { Value = "Atlanta" });

    cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Console.WriteLine("Successfully created new employee");

    conn.Close();
}
```

SQL Server, armed with the schema definitions and Always Encrypted configuration, understands exactly how each parameter passed to the `InsertCustomer` stored procedure is used. It knows which table columns correspond to each parameter, and so it knows how each parameter needs to be encrypted by the client:
  
  - The `@Name` parameter, tied to the `Name` column configured with randomized encryption, is encrypted on the client-side using the column's encryption key (CEK1) before being sent to the database.
  
  - The `@SSN` parameter, associated with the `SSN` column that uses deterministic encryption, also utilizes CEK1 but in a way that allows identical values to be encrypted to the same ciphertext. This supports querying on the encrypted column.
  
  - The `@Name` and `@City` parameters, mapping to columns without encryption, are sent as plain text since the respective `Name` and `City` columns don't require encryption.

Run the application, and observe that SQL Server processes the encrypted parameters appropriately, securely inserting the new employee record into the `Employee` table. The successful console message confirms that the new employee, "Marcy Jones", has been added to the database.

Now switch back to SSMS and query the `Employee` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee
```

Observe the new row added for "Marcy Jones" by our client application. Again, remember that the encrypted data is visible in these query results only because the SSMS window is still running on a connection string with `column encryption setting=enabled`, and the CMK is accessible from the certificate store.

## How It Works

So how does this all work under the covers? The answer lies in the `sp_describe_parameter_encryption` system stored procedure. When a client application prepares a query that involves encrypted columns, it doesn't inherently know which parameters correspond to these encrypted columns or how they should be encrypted. This is where `sp_describe_parameter_encryption` comes into play. The client sends the text of the query to SQL Server, which then executes `sp_describe_parameter_encryption` with the query text as an argument.

This stored procedure analyzes the query and returns detailed information about each parameter in the query, including whether a parameter maps to an encrypted column, the encryption type (deterministic or randomized), and the encryption keys to use. This information allows the client to encrypt query parameters correctly before sending the actual query to the server.

Based on the information returned by `sp_describe_parameter_encryption`, the client encrypts parameters that correspond to encrypted columns using the appropriate keys and encryption types, and then sends the encrypted query to SQL Server.

## Cleanup

To clean up the resources you've created, follow these important steps carefully. This process removes the Column Master Key (CMK) used by Always Encrypted and deletes the `MyEncryptedDB` database. 

### Step 1: Delete the Column Master Key (CMK)

Back in the Certificate Manager, navigate to the "Personal" certificates store and find the certificate whose name starts with "Always Encrypted Auto Certificate". This certificate is the CMK we created with the Always Encrypted wizard at the beginning of the previous lab. Right-click on the certificate and choose "Delete", and confirm the deletion.

**Once the CMK is deleted (and no other copies or backups of the CMK are available), data encrypted by CEKs which used that CMK is permanently lost.** Understand that deleting this certificate (CMK) without having it properly backed up or exported means that the `SSN` and `Salary` data encrypted under this key is irretrievably lost. In the real world, ensure that you either have no need for the encrypted data or have exported the key elsewhere if needed.

### Step 2: Delete the `MyEncryptedDB` Database

Switch back to SSMS. In the Object Explorer, expand the Databases node, right-click on `MyEncryptedDB`, and select "Delete". In the "Delete Object" dialog, select the "Close existing connections" checkbox. Then click "OK". This action will remove the `MyEncryptedDB` database and all its data from your SQL Server instance.
