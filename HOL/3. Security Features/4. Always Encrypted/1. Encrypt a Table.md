# Encrypt a Table

This first lab will guide you through the process of encrypting several columns within a SQL Server table, using the Always Encrypted functionality. This will provide practical experience in handling encrypted data, encompassing querying and updating operations within SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The aim is to not only familiarize students with the encryption process but also to equip them with the skills needed to interact with encrypted data efficiently.

Start by pressing `CTRL+N` to open a new query window for this lab in SSMS.

### Step 1: Create and Initialize the Database

Let's start by creating a new database specifically for our Always Encrypted labs. Run the following code to create and use `MyEncryptedDb`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE MyEncryptedDB
USE MyEncryptedDB
```

### Step 2: Create the Customer Table and Populate it with Data

In this step, we will create a table named `Customer` in the `MyEncryptedDB` database. This table is designed to store information about customers, including their names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs), and city of residence. Following the table creation, we'll populate it with sample data to simulate a real-world scenario where sensitive information is stored in a database.

Specifically, the `Name` and `SSN` columns contain sensitive data that should be protected. To this end, we will use the Always Encrypted feature to encrypt these columns, ensuring that the sensitive information they contain is secure. Run this code to create, populate, and query the `Customer` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer(
    CustomerId int IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    Name varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    SSN varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    City varchar(20) NOT NULL
)

INSERT INTO Customer VALUES
 ('James Miller', '123-45-6789', 'New York'),
 ('Doug Nichols', '987-65-4321', 'Boston'),
 ('Joe Anonymous', 'n/a', 'Chicago')

SELECT * FROM Customer
```

This table now holds sensitive customer information in the `Name` and `SSN` columns. By encrypting these columns using Always Encrypted, we can ensure that the sensitive data is only accessible through authorized applications, significantly enhancing data security and privacy.

Proceeding to the next step, we will configure Always Encrypted for the `Customer` table, focusing on encrypting the `Name` and `SSN` columns to safeguard this sensitive information.


### Step 3: Encrypting Sensitive Data with Always Encrypted

In this step, we will utilize the Always Encrypted Wizard within SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to encrypt sensitive data within the `Customer` table, specifically targeting the `Name` and `SSN` columns. The encryption process safeguards the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information, aligning with best practices for data security.

**Understanding Encryption Choices and Configurations:**

- **Column Encryption Keys (CEKs) and Column Master Keys (CMKs):** Always Encrypted utilizes two types of keys. The Column Encryption Key (CEK) is used to directly encrypt data in the database, while the Column Master Key (CMK) is the "key-encrypting key" that encrypts the CEKs. For simplicity in our demonstration, we will use one CEK for both columns, though in practice, each column could have its own CEK. The CMK will be created and stored in the certificate store on the client machine, and its metadata (not the key itself) will be saved in the database to allow client applications to access the CMK and, by extension, the encrypted data.

- **Encryption Types:** The `SSN` column will use deterministic encryption, enabling queries on encrypted data due to its predictable encryption pattern. However, this comes at the cost of reduced security compared to randomized encryption, which we will apply to the `Name` column. Randomized encryption offers enhanced security by preventing attackers from inferring information about the encrypted data, making it impossible to search or sort.

- **Storage and Management of Keys:** Ideally, CMKs are stored in Azure Key Vault, which simplifies key management by providing a centralized location for key access, controlled by the vault's policies. However, for the ease of our exercise, we're using the certificate store on the same machine as SQL Server. It's crucial to understand that this setup contradicts the fundamental principle of Always Encrypted, where the CMK should not reside on the database server to ensure true client-side encryption. Our approach in this lab simplifies the process by avoiding the complexities of configuring Azure Key Vault and focuses on demonstrating the core functionality of Always Encrypted.

Before continuing, open the user certificate store on your computer by clicking Start, typing "cert", and choosing Manager User Certificates. Then navigate to **Personal > Certificates** to open the Certificate Manager, and scroll through the list of installed certificates (they are sorted alphabetically). Notice how there is no certificate that starts with the name "Always Encrypted." We will now use the wizard to create a new certificate here, and store the metadata in the database. Remember, we only have the certificate installed on the database server to simplify the exercise (we're using the same machine for the client and the server). This should normally never be done in realworld scenarios where only the client can access the certificate.

**Instructions:**

1. In SQL Server Management Studio, navigate to the `MyEncryptedDB` database in the Object Explorer.

2. Right-click on the database name and select **Tasks** > **Encrypt Columns** to launch the Always Encrypted Wizard. Click Next to advance past the Introduction page.

3. On the Column Selection page, select the `Name` and `SSN` columns for encryption. Set the encryption type for the `SSN` column to Deterministic, allowing for queries on this column. Choose Randomized encryption for the `Name` column to maximize security. Note that the wizard shows that one CEK will be created and used to encrypted both columns. Click Next to advance to the Master Key Configuration page.

4. On the Master Key Configuration page, notice that the only available option in the master key selection dropdown is to auto-generate a new CMK. This is because we haven't yet generated the CMK. For the key store provider option, stick with the default Windows Certificate Store option to create the master key in the user certificate store. This selection simplifies the demonstration by avoiding the setup complexities of Azure Key Vault. Click Next to advance to the In-Place Encryption Settings page.

5. Older versions of SSMS don't include the In-Place Encryption Settings page. This feature utilizes enclaves, an advanced feature that we are not utilizing in this lab. So just click Next to advance to the Run Settings page.

6. On the Run Settings page, you have the option to generate a PowerShell script to run the process later, or proceed to run it now. Leave the default setting to proceed to finish now, and click Next.

7. Review your selections on the Summary page. Notice that a new master key named CMK_Auto1 will be created in the database. This refers to the CMK metadata, which is the client-side certificate store path to the CMK, and not the CMK itself. You can see that a new column encryption key named CEK_Auto1 will also be created in the database. This refers to the CEK after it has been encrypted by the CMK, and not the CEK itself. Finally, note that the two columns Name and SSN will be encrypted by the CEK, using randomized encryption for the Name column and deterministic encryption for the SSN column.

8. Click Finish to being the encryption process. This will take a few moments as the wizard encrypts the selected columns.
 
When the wizard completes, refresh the list of certificates in the Certificate Manager. Notice that there is now a certificate named "Always Encrypted Auto Certificate1."

Now query from the table, and observe that the Name and SSN columns are not revealed, and appear encrypted instead:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer
```

### Step 4: Examining the Metadata of the Encrypted Columns

After successfully configuring Always Encrypted for our `Customer` table, focusing on the sensitive `Name` and `SSN` columns, it's essential to understand how SQL Server treats the encrypted data from a metadata perspective. This understanding is crucial for database design, querying encrypted columns, and maintaining data integrity.

**Instructions:**

1. **Generate the Table Script:**
   - In SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), navigate to your `MyEncryptedDB` database and expand the "Tables" folder.
   - Right-click on the `Customer` table, select "Script Table as" > "CREATE To" > "New Query Editor Window". This action generates the T-SQL script used to create the `Customer` table, including the definitions for the encrypted columns.

2. **Observing Data Types and ENCRYPTED WITH Syntax:**
   - In the generated script, note that the data types for the `Name` and `SSN` columns remain as `varchar(20)`, unchanged from their original definitions. This detail is significant, highlighting that Always Encrypted treats these columns as logically holding `varchar` data, despite physically storing encrypted binary data that can exceed the specified character length.
   - Additionally, you'll observe the `ENCRYPTED WITH` clause for each column, specifying the encryption type and referencing a Column Encryption Key (CEK), likely named `CEK_Auto1`. The `Name` column is specified to use randomized encryption, offering higher security by preventing the inference of encrypted values. Conversely, the `SSN` column employs deterministic encryption, enabling the possibility of exact-value searches but at a trade-off in security.

3. **Understanding the Importance of Collation:**
   - The script also defines the collation for the encrypted columns as `Latin_General_BIN2`. The `BIN2` suffix denotes a binary collation, crucial for the deterministic encryption used on the `SSN` column. This binary collation ensures that data comparisons are binary, thus case-sensitive. While deterministic encryption allows for searching and indexing of the `SSN` column, the binary collation impacts how these operations are performed. Specifically, all comparisons against the `SSN` column, including searches, will be case-sensitive, diverging from the default case-insensitive behavior seen with most other collations. This characteristic must be carefully considered when designing queries and data access patterns, especially for columns under deterministic encryption.

By closely examining the table's metadata post-encryption, we gain valuable insights into how Always Encrypted integrates with SQL Server's data type system and the implications for querying encrypted columns. This step underscores the balance between security (through encryption) and functionality (through data types and collation settings), guiding us in effectively designing and interacting with our encrypted data.

### Step 5: Examining the Metadata of Encryption Keys

Now that our `Customer` table columns are encrypted with Always Encrypted, it's vital to understand the underlying encryption key infrastructure. Although SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) provides a graphical interface to view Always Encrypted keys under the `Security > Always Encrypted Keys` node of the `MyEncryptedDB` database, we'll dive deeper using T-SQL queries. This approach offers a detailed view of the metadata associated with Column Master Keys (CMKs) and Column Encryption Keys (CEKs).

**Instructions:**

1. **Querying Encryption Key Metadata:**
   - Open a new query window in SSMS connected to the `MyEncryptedDB` database.
   - To discover and examine the Always Encrypted keys, execute the following T-SQL commands:

```sql
-- Discover Always Encrypted keys
SELECT * FROM sys.column_master_keys;
SELECT * FROM sys.column_encryption_keys;
SELECT * FROM sys.column_encryption_key_values;
```

2. **Understanding CMK Metadata:**
   - The results from `sys.column_master_keys` provide crucial details about the CMK. Notably, the `key_store_provider_name` column indicates `MSSQL_CERTIFICATE_STORE`, revealing that our CMK is stored in the local machine's certificate store. The `key_path` column specifies the exact location within the certificate store where the CMK resides, ensuring that only authorized client applications with access to this certificate can perform encryption or decryption operations.
   - It's important to recognize that the `key_store_provider_name` could also display `AZURE_KEY_VAULT`, for CMKs stored in Azure Key Vault. In such cases, the `key_path` would point to the URI of the CMK within Azure Key Vault, centralizing key management and access control through Azure's cloud infrastructure.

3. **Exploring CEK Metadata:**
   - The metadata related to CEKs is divided between `sys.column_encryption_keys` and `sys.column_encryption_key_values`. The former table reveals the name of the CEK, typically `CEK_Auto1`, along with a unique `column_encryption_key_id`. This identifier is crucial for joining with the latter table, which houses the `encrypted_value` column containing the CEK, encrypted by the CMK.
   - This layered encryption model underscores that the CEK, stored in its encrypted form in the database, is unusable for encrypting or decrypting data without the appropriate CMK. Only authorized clients with access to the CMK can decrypt the CEK, enabling them to subsequently encrypt or decrypt column data.

By closely examining the metadata of both CMKs and CEKs, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the encryption architecture employed by Always Encrypted. This knowledge is critical for database administrators and developers to ensure proper key management and security practices, especially when dealing with sensitive data. The distinction between storing keys in the local certificate store versus Azure Key Vault highlights the flexibility and security considerations integral to Always Encrypted's design.

Now run this next query, which discovers all the columns that use Always Encrypted, showing the column name, CEK database name, and encryption type:

```sql
-- Discover columns protected by Always Encrypted
SELECT
    [column] = c.name,
    c.column_encryption_key_id,
    cek = cek.name,
    column_encryption_key_database_name = ISNULL(column_encryption_key_database_name, DB_NAME()),
    encryption_type_desc,
    encryption_algorithm_name
FROM
    sys.columns AS c
    INNER JOIN sys.column_encryption_keys AS cek ON c.column_encryption_key_id = cek.column_encryption_key_id
WHERE
    c.column_encryption_key_id IS NOT NULL
```

### Step 6: Enabling Client Access to Encrypted Data

For a client application to access data protected by Always Encrypted in SQL Server, two crucial requirements must be met. Understanding and implementing these requirements correctly is essential for working with encrypted data seamlessly.

**Requirements for Accessing Encrypted Data:**

1. **Access to the Column Master Key (CMK):** The client must have access to the CMK to decrypt the Column Encryption Key (CEK), which, in turn, decrypts the data. In our scenario, the CMK we created resides in our certificate store, ensuring we have the necessary access to it.

2. **Proper Configuration of the Connection String:** The client's connection string must include the parameter "column encryption setting=enabled". This inclusion signals SQL Server to automatically decrypt the data returned by queries, assuming the client has access to the CMK. Without this parameter, encrypted columns will not be decrypted, appearing as binary data to the client.

**Instructions to Modify the Connection String in SSMS:**

1. **Accessing the Connect Dialog:**
   - Right-click in the query window, and choose **Connection > Change Connection** to open the "Connect to Database Engine" dialog. Then click on the "Options >>" button to expand the dialog with additional options.

2. **Configuring Always Encrypted:**
   - While you could manually enter "column encryption setting=enabled" in the "Additional Connection Parameters" tab, there's a more straightforward approach. Navigate to the "Always Encrypted" tab, and simply check the "Enable Always Encrypted" checkbox. This action instructs SSMS to automatically append "column encryption setting=enabled" to your connection string, streamlining the process.
   
3. **Reconnecting to the Database:**
   - After clicking the "Connect" button with the "Enable Always Encrypted" option selected, SSMS may default your session to the master database. To continue working with the `MyEncryptedDB` database, you'll need to switch back to it. You can do this by selecting `MyEncryptedDB` from the database dropdown at the top of the query window. This step ensures that your queries target the correct database context, allowing you to interact with the encrypted data successfully.

Now that both requirements are met, we should be able to view the encrypted data. Run the query again:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer
```

At this point, SSMS will display the Parameterization for Always Encrypted dialog. Click Enable to enable the feature for this query window, which will be crucial in the next step when we attempt to insert and update encrypted data as well.

Now observe how both encrypted columns are now visible in plain text. This is because the client (SSMS in this case) is able to use the CMK to decrypt the CEK, which is then used to decrypt the columns themselves.

### Step 7: Querying Encrypted Data with Deterministic Encryption

When working with Always Encrypted in SQL Server, querying encrypted columns requires an understanding of how encryption affects data retrieval. Let's explore this concept through the process of querying the `Customer` table for a specific Social Security Number (SSN).

**First Attempt: Direct Query**

Initially, you might attempt to query for a customer with an SSN value of 'n/a' using a straightforward SQL command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE SSN = 'n/a'
```

Executing this query by selecting the text and pressing F5 results in the query being sent directly to the server for execution. However, because 'n/a' is stored in the database using deterministic encryption, it needs to be encrypted client-side before the query is executed on the server. This direct approach does not allow for the client-side encryption of the 'n/a' value, leading to a failed query attempt.

**Requirements for Successful Encrypted Data Query:**

1. **Parameterization:** The query must be parameterized. This means instead of directly including the value in the query, you use a parameter that SQL Server can recognize as needing to be encrypted before the server-side query execution.

2. **ADO.NET Client Provider:** The query needs to be processed through the ADO.NET client provider, which supports Always Encrypted by automatically encrypting parameter values client-side. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) can handle this because we enabled Parameterization for Always Encrypted.

**Second Attempt: Parameterized Query**

Let's retry the query with these considerations in mind:

```sql
DECLARE @Ssn varchar(20) = 'n/a'
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE SSN = @Ssn
```

After adjusting the query to use a parameterized approach and executing it, you'll notice the query succeeds in returning the desired records. This success is due to SSMS encrypting the value of `@Ssn` client-side, matching the encrypted value stored in the database.

**Observing SqlParameter Use:**

When you parameterize your query in SSMS, you might observe blue squiggly lines beneath the parameter declaration. Hovering the mouse cursor over these lines reveals that SSMS is using a `SqlParameter` under the hood, thanks to the enabled Parameterization for Always Encrypted. This visual cue is a helpful reminder that SSMS is handling the encryption requirements automatically, ensuring your query interacts correctly with the encrypted data.

This step underscores the importance of correctly structuring queries to interact with Always Encrypted data. By adhering to the requirements of parameterization and leveraging the capabilities of the ADO.NET client provider, you can successfully query encrypted columns, maintaining the security and privacy of sensitive data.

Now let's explore the impact of case sensitivity:

```sql
DECLARE @Ssn varchar(20) = 'N/A'
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE SSN = @Ssn
```

Executing this query with 'N/A' in all caps results in no matches. This behavior is due to the deterministic encryption using a binary collation, which is case-sensitive. The 'n/a' in the database does not match 'N/A' in our query because of this case sensitivity, a crucial consideration when querying deterministically encrypted data.

### Step 8: Inserting Encrypted Data into the Customer Table

When inserting new data into a table with columns protected by Always Encrypted, the process involves more than just the execution of an `INSERT` statement. The ADO.NET client provider plays a critical role in ensuring that data which needs to be encrypted is processed correctly before it's sent over the network to the SQL Server. This step will demonstrate the insertion of a new customer record into the `Customer` table, highlighting the encryption process.

**Inserting a New Customer:**

Consider the following SQL command to insert a new customer record:

```sql
DECLARE @NewName varchar(20) = 'John Smith'
DECLARE @NewSsn varchar(20) = '246-80-1357'
DECLARE @NewCity varchar(20) = 'Los Angeles'
INSERT INTO Customer VALUES
 (@NewName, @NewSsn, @NewCity)
```

**How Encryption Works in This Context:**

1. **Client-Side Encryption:** The ADO.NET client provider automatically encrypts the data for the `Name` and `SSN` columns client-side, based on the column encryption keys (CEKs) and the encryption type defined in the server-side metadata. This means that 'John Smith' and '246-80-1357' are encrypted before the `INSERT` statement is sent to SQL Server. This process is transparent, requiring no additional steps to encrypt the data manually.

2. **Encryption Key and Type Determination:** The client-side provider uses the server-side metadata associated with each column to determine:
   - That 'John Smith' should be encrypted using randomized encryption.
   - That '246-80-1357' needs to be encrypted using deterministic encryption, allowing for exact matches in queries.
   - That 'Los Angeles', stored in the `City` column, does not require encryption as defined by the absence of encryption metadata for this column.

3. **Transmission Over the Network:** Once the data is encrypted as needed, the `INSERT` statement, now carrying encrypted values for `Name` and `SSN`, is sent over the network to SQL Server. The `City` value is sent as plain text, as no encryption is applied to this column.

Now query the table again:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer
```
Observe the newly inserted row with `Name` and `SSN` values that were encrypted client-side when we executed the `INSERT` statement, and decrypted client-side when executing this `SELECT` statement.
