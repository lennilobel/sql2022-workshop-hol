# Updateable Ledger Tables

In this lab, we'll explore the second type of ledger table, updateable ledger tables.

Unlike append-only ledger tables, updateable ledger tables allow updates and deletes but still maintain a complete, immutable history of changes. This supports scenarios where data needs to be updated or corrected, but you still require a full non-tamperable audit trail of all modifications.

Continue working in the same query window as the previous lab, which is still connected to the `LedgerLab` database.

## Create an Updateable Ledger Table

Let's create an `Balance` table as an updateable ledger table. This table will keep track of customer balances. By enabling ledger functionality with `SYSTEM_VERSIONING`, we create an updateable ledger table; that is, a ledger table that allows updates and deletions. And yes, using the `SYSTEM_VERSIONING` employs a mechanism for updateable ledger tables that works very similarly to temporal tables.

Here's the code to create the `Balance` table as an updateable ledger table, along with its `dbo.Balance_History` history table for storing the history of changes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Balance (
    CustomerId int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED,
    LastName varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    Balance decimal(10,2) NOT NULL
)
WITH (
    LEDGER = ON,
    SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (
        HISTORY_TABLE = dbo.Balance_History
    )
)
```

This definition allows the `Balance` table to be modified while keeping an immutable history of all changes in the `Balance_History` table. This approach combines the flexibility of updateable data with the security and transparency benefits of ledger technology.

Creating the `Balance` table as an updateable ledger table is a DDL operation that gets associated with another transaction, and has caused the database ledger digest to update accordingly:

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_generate_database_ledger_digest
```

This procedure call returns the latest database digest, including the new block ID incremented by the creation of the `Balance` table. The new block ID should be 3, since the last transaction from the end of the previous lab was tied to block ID 2.

## Discover Ledger Metadata

All ledger tables are associated with a corresponding ledger view (which we'll explore shortly), where updateable ledgers are also associated with a corresponding history table (similar to a temporal history table).

To explore the ledger tables in the database along with their associated ledger views and (for updateable ledger tables) the names of their history tables, you can use a query that joins `sys.tables`, `sys.schemas`, and `sys.views` like so:

```sql
SELECT 
    ts.name + '.' + t.name AS LedgerTableName,
    vs.name + '.' + v.name AS LedgerViewName,
    hs.name + '.' + h.name AS HistoryTableName
FROM
    sys.tables AS t
    INNER JOIN sys.schemas ts ON (ts.schema_id = t.schema_id)
    INNER JOIN sys.views v ON (v.object_id = t.ledger_view_id)
    INNER JOIN sys.schemas vs ON (vs.schema_id = v.schema_id)
    LEFT JOIN sys.tables AS h ON (h.object_id = t.history_table_id)
    LEFT JOIN sys.schemas hs ON (hs.schema_id = h.schema_id)
WHERE
    t.ledger_view_id IS NOT NULL
```

This query yields a list of ledger tables within the current database, displaying each table's name, the name of its ledger view, and the name of its history table (for updateable ledger tables only). This view helps to understand the structure and relationships of ledger tables within your database.

In our scenario, the query results show that `dbo.KeyCardEvent` and `dbo.Balance` are ledger tables. Each of these tables has an associated ledger view, named `dbo.KeyCardEvent_Ledger` and `dbo.Balance_Ledger`, respectively.

Furthermore, `dbo.KeyCardEvent` is an append-only ledger table, designed to prevent updates and deletes and ensure data immutability. Consequently, it does not have an associated history table because its ledger functionality does not require tracking changes over time.

Conversely, `dbo.Balance` is an updateable ledger table, which supports tracking changes through updates and deletions while ensuring the integrity and immutability of historical data. This is facilitated by the history table named `dbo.Balance_History`, which serves as an archive for previous versions of data rows, capturing the state of data before any modifications. 

## Populate the Updateable Ledger Table

Let's insert our first row into the `Balance` table for Nick Jones with an initial balance of 50:

```sql
INSERT INTO Balance VALUES
 (1, 'Jones', 'Nick', 50)
```

Since `Balance` is an updateable ledger table, this transaction not only affects the primary table but also creates a corresponding entry in the history table `dbo.Balance_History` (which we'll examine shortly) to record this change for audit and verification purposes. This also means we've created another transaction for this `INSERT`, as you can see by examining the ledger's database digest once again:

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_generate_database_ledger_digest
```

Inspect the updated database digest, where the block ID has been incremented once more (from 3 to 4). This increment highlights the addition of a new transaction block to the ledger, linked to the prior block's hash, thereby maintaining the chain's integrity.

Now let's add three more customers with different balances:

```sql
INSERT INTO Balance VALUES
 (2, 'Smith', 'John', 500),
 (3, 'Smith', 'Joe', 30),
 (4, 'Michaels', 'Mary', 200)
```

Once again, examine the ledger's database digest:

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_generate_database_ledger_digest
```

As you probably exected by now, this has resulted in one more transaction, associated with the new block ID that's been incremented from 4 to 5.

## Hidden Updateable Ledger Table Columns

Like we saw with append-only ledger tables in the previous lab, updateable ledger tables also have hidden ledger columns. However, updateable ledger tables have *two* sets of ledger columns, corresponding to the starting and ending transactions associated with each version of a changed row (again, similar to the period columns of a temporal table).

Run the following query to view all data in the `Balance` table, including the two sets of hidden ledger columns:

```sql
SELECT 
    *,
    ledger_start_transaction_id,
    ledger_end_transaction_id,
    ledger_start_sequence_number,
    ledger_end_sequence_number
FROM
    Balance
```

Examining the results, observe:

1. **Nick's Transaction ID:** Take note of the `ledger_start_transaction_id` for Nick Jones. This ID marks the transaction in which Nick's row was initially inserted. We'll see this ID change as we update Nick's row, indicating a new transaction for each update of this specific row.

2. **Shared Transaction ID:** The unique transaction ID for Nick Jones differs from the shared transaction ID used for John Smith, Joe Smith, and Mary Michaels. This distinction arises because Nick's entry was added in a separate transaction, while the other three were batch-inserted in a different single transaction. This demonstrates SQL Server's handling of transaction IDs based on the DML execution rather than the row count.

3. **Start and End Values in Updateable Ledger Tables:** The `ledger_start_transaction_id`, `ledger_end_transaction_id`, `ledger_start_sequence_number`, and `ledger_end_sequence_number` columns are noteworthy. In updateable ledger tables like `Balance`, both start and end values are present. Unlike append-only ledger tables, which only maintain `ledger_start_transaction_id` and `ledger_start_sequence_number`, updateable ledger tables also track `ledger_end_transaction_id` and `ledger_end_sequence_number` to delineate the end of a row's validity. The end values remain `NULL` in the main table to indicate the row's current version but are populated in the history table upon row updates or deletions, offering a clear audit trail akin to the functionality provided by temporal tables.

## Updating Data and Saving History

Now let's observe what happens when we update data in an updateable ledger table.

```sql
-- Change Nick's balance from $50 to $100
UPDATE Balance SET Balance = 100
    WHERE CustomerId = 1

-- Observe the incremented digest block ID
EXEC sys.sp_generate_database_ledger_digest

-- Note Nick's ledger_start_transaction_id changed
SELECT 
    *,
    ledger_start_transaction_id,
    ledger_end_transaction_id,
    ledger_start_sequence_number,
    ledger_end_sequence_number
FROM
    Balance

-- Ledger history table has a previous row for Nick
SELECT * FROM Balance_History
```

In this sequence, we first update Nick Jones's balance from $50 to $100 in the `Balance` table. Following the update, the `EXEC sys.sp_generate_database_ledger_digest` command reveals an incremented block ID from 5 to 6, indicating the inclusion of this update as a new transaction in the database's ledger.

The next query shows us the `Balance` table, where you can see that Nick's `ledger_start_transaction_id` has changed from its previous value, to reflect the transaction of his balance update. Now take note of this new transaction ID as it will change again when we update this row once more.

Then, by querying the `Balance_History` table, we see a history row for Nick, showing his balance as $50 associated with the previous transaction ID value. This demonstrates how the history table records previous versions of data rows, akin to temporal tables. But unlike temporal tables, the history table of an updateable ledger table cannot be tampered with.

Let's perform one more update, this time updating Nick's balance once again from $100 to $150.

```sql
-- Change Nick's balance from $100 to $150
UPDATE Balance SET Balance = 150
    WHERE CustomerId = 1

-- Observe the incremented digest block ID
EXEC sys.sp_generate_database_ledger_digest

-- Note Nick's ledger_start_transaction_id changed again
SELECT 
    *,
    ledger_start_transaction_id,
    ledger_end_transaction_id,
    ledger_start_sequence_number,
    ledger_end_sequence_number
FROM
    Balance

-- Ledger history table has two previous rows for Nick
SELECT * FROM Balance_History
```

After executing the update, notice that the database digest once more shows an incremented block ID (from 6 to 7), adding another transaction to the database ledger for this balance change.

Inspecting the `Balance` table, you'll find that Nick's `ledger_start_transaction_id` has updated once more to represent the latest transaction ID of the balance change to $150.

And then, examining the `Balance_History` table now reveals two history rows for Nick, corresponding to his previous balances of $50 and $100. Each row is linked to its own unique transaction (associated with changing transaction IDs that you've been nothing throughout the exercise).

## Ledger View

Now let's examine the ledger view associated with our `Balance` table, which by default is named `Balance_Ledger` (you can name the ledger view anything you wish by specifying the name explictly when creating the updateable ledger table).

```sql
SELECT * FROM Balance_Ledger
ORDER BY ledger_transaction_id, ledger_sequence_number
```

The ledger view plays a crucial role in amalgamating data from the main table with its history, creating a comprehensive and immutable audit trail of changes. This unified view not only shows each transaction ID and sequence number but also categorizes the nature of each operation conducted on the data.

Note the operation types reported by the ledger view. Unlike append-only ledger tables where the operation type is always INSERT, updateable tables also DELETE operations in the ledger view. Observe how each UPDATE operation we executed on Nick's row is actually represented as a pair of INSERT and DELETE operations, where the INSERT denotes the transaction introducing the new values, and the DELETE encapsulates the prior state of the data.

This dual representation for updates offers a transparent and detailed audit trail, ensuring any changes made are clearly documented and accessible. The `Balance_Ledger` view thus becomes an indispensable tool for auditing and compliance, providing a detailed and indisputable history of all data manipulations within the updateable ledger table.

## Ledger Verification

To perform ledger verification in SQL Server 2022, you can use the `sp_verify_database_ledger` stored procedure, which ensures the integrity of the database's ledger by confirming that the provided database digest is accurate and untampered. This process is vital for maintaining trust in the ledger's immutability and the integrity of the data within.

Firstly, run the `sp_generate_database_ledger_digest` procedure to generate the current database digest. The digest is a JSON payload that includes information like the database digest block number and hash, representing the state of the ledger up to the most recent transaction:

```sql
-- Get the current database digest
EXEC sp_generate_database_ledger_digest
```

If you've followed along with the instructions step-by-step, you'll notice that the block ID for the current digest is 7.

In the results pane, right-click on the database digest JSON, and click Copy. Then open Notepad and paste it there so that we can access it later for ledger verification. This manual step is particularly necessary for on-premises SQL Server 2022 setups. Azure SQL Database automates this by allowing automatic storage of the digest in Azure Immutable Blob Storage, providing a way for external parties to perform continuous verification and ensure the database's integrity remains uncompromised.

Before proceeding with verification, you need to enable snapshot isolation for the database. This is necessary for ensuring the consistency of the verification process and preventing any blocking issues during the operation.

```sql
-- Enable snapshot isolation
ALTER DATABASE LedgerLab SET ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON
```

Now use the `sp_verify_database_ledger` procedure to verify the database's ledger integrity by providing the previously obtained digest as an argument. Replace `<paste-in-the-digest-json-here>` with the actual JSON digest you copied earlier and pasted into Notepad.

```sql
-- Verify the database ledger
EXEC sp_verify_database_ledger N'<paste-in-the-digest-json-here>'
```

In the Results tab, a simple result showing the last verified block ID as 7 indicates successful verification. Click on the Messages tab to view a message stating that ledger verification was successful.

This verification step is an essential practice in maintaining the security and integrity of the database, offering peace of mind that the data's historical record remains secure and unaltered.

Now break the verification by changing any single hex character of the digest hash in the `EXEC sp_verify_database_ledger` statement, and then run the statement again. This time, error messages appear in the Messages tab, indicating that the database ledger digest doesn't match the digest supplied for verification.

## Dropping Ledger Tables

When you drop a ledger table, it isn't immediately permanently deleted. Instead, it gets retained as a "deleted ledger table." This ensures that the integrity and auditability of the ledger data are preserved even after the tables are no longer actively used in the database.

Go ahead and drop both ledger tables:

```sql
DROP TABLE KeyCardEvent       -- Append-only ledger table is renamed and moved to "Dropped Ledger Tables" in SSMS
DROP TABLE Balance            -- Updateable ledger table and its history table are renamed and moved to "Dropped Ledger Tables" in SSMS
```

Now view the database digest one last time:

```sql
EXEC sp_generate_database_ledger_digest
```

You'll observe that these operations are captured as a single transaction, incrementing the database digest block ID from 7 to 8. This behavior underscores the ledger's ability to record every transaction, even the dropping of ledger tables which are actually just "soft-deleted" in the database.

To verify the status of the dropped tables, query the `sys.tables` system catalog view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.tables
```

This query shows that the tables still exist in the database, but they have been renamed to indicate their status as dropped tables.

Dropped ledger tables can also be viewed in the Object Explorer in SSMS. Right-click the Databases folder in Object Explorer and select Refresh. Expand the `LedgerLab` database, and then expand the Tables folder beneath the database. It appears as though there are no tables in the database, but expanding the Dropped Ledger Tables reveals the two ledger tables we just deleted. And then expanding the dropped updateable `Balance` ledger table (which has now been renamed to `MSSQL_DroppedLedgerTable_Balance...`) reveals the the associated history table that was deleted as well.

## Cleanup

To completely remove all traces of the database, including all ledger and deleted ledger tables, delete the database itself.

In the Object Explorer, beneath the Databases folder, right-click on `LedgerLab`, and select "Delete". In the "Delete Object" dialog, select the "Close existing connections" checkbox. Then click "OK". This action will remove the `LedgerLab` database and all its data from your SQL Server instance.

Again, dropping the database is a permanent action that deletes the database and all its contents, including any ledger tables and their associated history. This action should normally be taken with caution, as it cannot be undone.
