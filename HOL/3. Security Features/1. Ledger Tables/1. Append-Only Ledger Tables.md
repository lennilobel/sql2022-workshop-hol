# Introducing Ledger Tables

Ledger is a new feature in SQL Server 2022 designed to provide a secure and immutable record of database transactions, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance data integrity and auditability.

There are two types of ledger tables: append-only, which are intended for scenarios where data should be added but not modified or deleted; and updateable, which allow for more flexibility by permitting updates and deletions while still maintaining a comprehensive and immutable history of changes. In the next two labs, we'll explore both types, starting with append-only ledger tables to understand their immutable nature, followed by updateable ledger tables to see how SQL Server tracks and secures changes over time.

Start by pressing `CTRL+N` to open a new query window for this lab. You'll be learning how to work with ledger tables over the next two labs, so when you complete this lab, keep the query window open before continuing to the next lab.

## Create the Sample Database

Let's set up our environment for working with ledger tables in SQL Server. The first step is to create a new database for our ledger table labs:

```sql
-- Create a new database for our ledger table labs
CREATE DATABASE LedgerLab
GO

USE LedgerLab
```

After creating the database, call the `sys.sp_generate_database_ledger_digest` stored procedure to generate the initial database ledger *digest*. At this initial stage, because the database is new and no transactions have been recorded yet, the digest will be `NULL`. This serves as our baseline; as transactions are executed, the digest will change, reflecting the ledger's tamper-evident nature by showing a JSON payload with the database digest block number and hash.

```sql
-- Generate the initial database ledger digest
-- At this point, since no transactions have occurred within the ledger-enabled database, 
-- the digest will be NULL, indicating no ledger-based changes or transactions have been recorded.
EXEC sys.sp_generate_database_ledger_digest
```

## Create an Append-Only Ledger Table

Now we'll focus on creating an append-only ledger table. This example uses a table named `KeyCardEvent` to record employee key card swipes, as employees entering a building. Given the table's event-oriented purpose, it's structured to be append-only, reinforcing the idea that once a swipe event is recorded, it cannot be altered; updates and deletions do not apply to the nature of this data:

```sql
-- Create an append-only ledger table named KeyCardEvent
CREATE TABLE KeyCardEvent (
    EmployeeId int NOT NULL,
    Operation varchar(1024) NOT NULL,
    CreatedAt datetime2 NOT NULL
)
WITH (
    LEDGER = ON (
        APPEND_ONLY = ON
    )
)
```

The `CREATE TABLE` statement is enhanced with the `LEDGER = ON (APPEND_ONLY = ON)` option to enforce these constraints, turning our table into an append-only ledger table.

Now that we've created the table, invoke the `sys.sp_generate_database_ledger_digest` stored procedure again to observe changes in the database digest:

```sql
-- Retrieve the database digest after the creation of the ledger table
-- This digest will now reflect the first transaction, indicating the immutable record 
-- of the table's creation within the database ledger.
EXEC sys.sp_generate_database_ledger_digest
```

At this juncture, the database digest will reflect the first transaction - the creation of our ledger table. The digest output includes a block ID (starting at 0 for the very first transaction), and a hash value. This hash represents the current state of the database ledger, encapsulating all transactions up to this point, whic at this stage includes just our `CREATE TABLE` operation.

Thus, SQL Server's ledger feature provides a verifiable and tamper-evident record of all database transactions. Each transaction is recorded in the `sys.database_ledger_transactions` catalog view (which we'll examine shortly), and alters the database digest, creating an audit trail that enhances data transparency and security.

## Populate the Append-Only Ledger Table

Now, we'll simulate the scenario of an employee swiping their badge to enter a building by inserting a row into our append-only ledger table. This first row records employee ID 43869 entering building 42 on June 2, 2022, at 6:55 PM. After inserting this event, we retrieve the database digest again:

```sql
INSERT INTO KeyCardEvent VALUES
 (43869, 'Building42', '2022-06-02T18:55:22')

EXEC sys.sp_generate_database_ledger_digest
```

The database digest now reflects a block ID of 1, which indicates this is the second transaction (the first one being the creation of the table). Moreover, the updated hash value in the digest is derived from this transaction's hash combined with the hash of the previous block, thus implementing a blockchain structure for the database digest. 

When inserting multiple rows with a single `INSERT` statement into an append-only ledger table, SQL Server treats the entire operation as a single transaction. This behavior is reflected in the database's ledger digest, where a single block ID represents the transaction, not the individual row insertions. The block ID increases with each transaction, not with each row, emphasizing the transactional nature of ledger updates. To demonstrate, insert two more rows with one statement and then retrieve the updated digest once more:

```sql
INSERT INTO KeyCardEvent VALUES
 (43869, 'Building49', '2022-06-02T19:58:47'),
 (19557, 'Building97', '2022-06-02T20:01:56')

EXEC sys.sp_generate_database_ledger_digest
```

Notice that the block ID has been incremented by one (from 1 to 2), for the one transaction that inserted multiple rows.

## Hidden Append-Only Ledger Table Columns

In SQL Server's append-only ledger tables, two hidden ledger columns, `ledger_start_transaction_id` and `ledger_start_sequence_number`, are automatically added to track transactional metadata. These columns are not visible when executing a standard `SELECT *` query, maintaining the simplicity of the table's schema for general use. However, these hidden columns can be explicitly queried to reveal the underlying ledger framework that supports the append-only integrity and auditability of the table. The `ledger_start_transaction_id` column shows the transaction ID associated with each row, and the `ledger_start_sequence_number` column distinguishes between multiple rows associated with the same transaction:

```sql
-- Appears as a standard table:
SELECT * FROM KeyCardEvent

-- Revealing hidden ledger columns:
SELECT
    *,
    ledger_start_transaction_id,
    ledger_start_sequence_number
FROM
    KeyCardEvent
```

In SQL Server's append-only ledger tables, the hidden columns for the transaction ID and sequence number provide essential details about the transactions that affected each row. Here's how they work:

- **Transaction ID:** This column uniquely identifies the transaction under which the row was inserted. It's crucial for tracing the row back to a specific point in the database's transaction history.

- **Sequence Number:** This column distinguishes between rows associated with the same transaction. It's especially relevant for transactions that affect multiple rows.

Thus, when the first row was inserted into the ledger table, it was recorded with a unique transaction ID and a sequence number of 0, indicating it's the first (and in this case, the only) row inserted by that transaction.

When the next transaction inserted two rows into the ledger table, each row inserted by this transaction shares the same transaction ID, as they're part of the same transactional action. However, to differentiate between these rows, they have been assigned incremental sequence numbers starting from 0. Thus, the first row has a sequence number of 0, and the second row has a sequence number of 1.

The hidden columns for tracking transactional metadata are named `ledger_start_transaction_id` and `ledger_start_sequence_number` by default, but you aren't stuck with these names. When creating an append-only ledger table, you can specify custom names for these hidden columns. This is achieved by using the `TRANSACTION_ID_COLUMN_NAME` and `SEQUENCE_NUMBER_COLUMN_NAME` parameters within the `WITH LEDGER = ON` clause of the `CREATE TABLE` statement.

Furthermore, the these columns are only hidden from `SELECT *` queries because the `HIDDEN` keyword is applied to them by default, in order to keep the table's presentation clean and focused on the business data, while still maintaining a comprehensive audit trail under the hood.

However, you can make these columns visible in your `SELECT *` queries if you wish. If you prefer the transaction ID and sequence number columns not to be hidden, you can customize the `CREATE TABLE` statement, by including the definitions for these columns without applying the `HIDDEN` keyword.

## Querying `sys.database_ledger_transactions`

In a database with one or more ledger tables, the `sys.database_ledger_transactions` catalog view plays a crucial role in providing transparency and traceability for data stored in ledger tables. This view stores a record for each transaction that occurs on any ledger table within the database, including both Data Definition Language (DDL) transactions, such as creating a table, and Data Manipulation Language (DML) transactions, like inserting rows.

Let's view the transactions recorded in `sys.database_ledger_transactions` to this point:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.database_ledger_transactions
```

The results of this query show the three transactions associated with the three block IDs 0, 1, and 2. The first transaction represents the `CREATE TABLE` DDL statement. The second transaction represents the first `INSERT` statement that inserted a single row. And the third transaction represents the second `INSERT` statement that inserted the next two rows at once.

Each entry in `sys.database_ledger_transactions` is a unique transaction, identified by the `transaction_id`, and provides important details such as the timestamp (`commit_time`), the user responsible (`principal_name`), and a hash representing the transaction (`table_hashes`).

The `transaction_id` contained in the `KeyCardEvent` ledger table acts as a foreign key to this `sys.database_ledger_transactions` catalog view, establishing a direct link between table data and the transaction that affected it. 

The code below joins the ledger transaction catalog view with the `KeyCardEvent` table, demonstrating the relationship between transactions and table data:

```sql
-- Join to view transactions with data
--  block 0 = no key card event rows
--  block 1 = one new key card event row (INSERT)
--  block 2 = two new key card event rows (INSERT)
SELECT
    t.*,
    kce.*
FROM
    sys.database_ledger_transactions AS t
    LEFT JOIN KeyCardEvent AS kce ON kce.ledger_start_transaction_id = t.transaction_id
ORDER BY
    t.commit_time,
    kce.ledger_start_sequence_number
```

Observe that the first transaction for block 0 represents the `CREATE TABLE` operation, marking the ledger table's inception with a DDL transaction. Following this, block 1's transaction captures the first `INSERT` operation that adds a single row to the ledger table, classified as a DML transaction. The transaction for block 2, meanwhile, logs another `INSERT` operation that introduces two more rows to the table, again a DML action. To reiterate, even though the second `INSERT` affected multiple rows, it's been recorded as a single transaction whose transaction information appears twice in this query, due to the `LEFT JOIN` that relates it to two rows in the `KeyCardEvent` table.

## Attempting Updates or Deletes on Append-Only Ledger Tables

Append-only ledger tables are designed to be immutable; once a row is inserted, it cannot be updated or deleted. The following examples demonstrate this:

```sql
-- Try to update rows in the table; fails for append-only ledger table
UPDATE KeyCardEvent
    SET EmployeeId = 34184
    WHERE EmployeeId = 43869
```

Attempting to update any row in this table results in an error because the ledger table is configured to be append-only. This means that once data is written, it is set in stone (figuratively speaking).

```sql
-- Try to delete rows in the table; fails for append-only ledger table
DELETE KeyCardEvent
    WHERE EmployeeId = 43869
```

Similarly, attempting to delete any row from the table will also result in an error. This restriction is a key feature of append-only ledger tables, ensuring that all data inserted int the table is recorded by a transaction, and forever remains intact and unaltered.

Now you're ready to explore updateable ledger tables, which you'll explore in the next lab. So keep this query window open as you continue on.
