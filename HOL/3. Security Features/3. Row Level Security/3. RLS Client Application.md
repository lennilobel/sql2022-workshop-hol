# RLS Client Application

In this lab, we explore how to effectively integrate a client application with the Row-Level Security (RLS) policy established in the previous demo, which utilizes `SESSION_CONTEXT` to determine user identity. While in the prior lab we manually invoked `sp_set_session_context` from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for demonstration purposes, a real-world implementation requires setting the session context directly from your client application. This lab will guide you through the process of doing just that, demonstrating the crucial step of communicating user context from an application to the database to enforce RLS policies seamlessly.

We will first create a basic client application that connects to the database and tries to query the Sales table. Initially, because of the Row-Level Security (RLS) policy that's already in effect within the database, this application won't be able to retrieve any rows. Next, we modify the application to authenticate users. Once authenticated, the application sets the session context by calling `sp_set_session_context`, passing in the authenticated user's name. This informs the SQL Server of the user's identity, allowing the RLS policy to appropriately filter data access based on this user context.

## Create the Client Application

For the first step of this lab, we'll create a client application that will attempt to connect to the database and query the Sales table. Initially, we don't expect to retrieve any rows because of the Row-Level Security (RLS) policy in effect. Here's how to set up the application:

1. **Start Visual Studio**: Launch Visual Studio and create a new project. Choose "C# Console Application" as the project type and name it "RLSClient".

2. **Add NuGet Package**: Once your project is created, you'll need to add the `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` package to connect to SQL Server. To do this, go to Solution Explorer, right-click on "Dependencies" > "Manage NuGet Packages". In the NuGet Package Manager, search for `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`, select it, and click "Install".

3. **Program.cs Code**: Replace the existing code in `Program.cs` with the following snippet. This code sets up a connection to the database using specified credentials and attempts to query the "Sales" table. Given the RLS policy, the initial run won't display any rows from the Sales table because it enforces data access based on the user context. 

Here's the code to copy into `Program.cs`:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data;
using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient;

namespace RLSClient
{
    internal class Program
    {
        private const string ConnStr =
            "data source=.;initial catalog=AdventureWorks2019;uid=AppLogin;pwd=StrongP@$$w0rd;Trust Server Certificate=True;";

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            DisplayOrders();
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to continue");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        public static void DisplayOrders()
        {
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Order list:");

            using var conn = OpenSqlConnection();

            using var cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
            cmd.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM Sales";

            using var rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
            var count = 0;
            while (rdr.Read())
            {
                count++;
                Console.WriteLine(" " +
                    $"OrderID: {rdr["OrderID"]}; " +
                    $"SalesUsername: {rdr["SalesUsername"]}; " +
                    $"Product: {rdr["Product"]}; " +
                    $"Qty: {rdr["Qty"]}; "
                );
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Total orders: {0}", count);

            conn.Close();
            Console.WriteLine();
        }

        private static SqlConnection OpenSqlConnection()
        {
            var conn = new SqlConnection(ConnStr);
            conn.Open();

            return conn;
        }
    }
}
```

Notice how the `OpenSqlConnection` method simply returns a new open connection.

Now press F5 to run the application, and observe that no results are returned in the reader from our "SELECT * FROM Sales" query, because we have not established a username in session context.

This sets the foundation for your client application. Next, we'll enhance it to work with the RLS policy by incorporating user authentication and session context.


## Add Authentication

Next, we'll enhance the client application to include user authentication and manage session context. For this demo, we'll simplify the authentication logic by using a hardcoded password, "RLSDemo." Of course, in real-world applications, authentication should be robust, utilizing secure identity providers like Entra ID, Okta, or similar services to validate user identities securely.

However, for the sake of simplicity in this lab and to focus on demonstrating the integration with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies, we'll proceed with a straightforward hardcoded password check. This approach allows us to simulate the authentication step without the complexity of integrating with external authentication services. The key takeaway here is not the authentication mechanism itself but how, upon successful authentication, we utilize session context within SQL Server to enforce RLS policies based on the authenticated user identity.

### Create a `_username` Field

Introduce a static string field named `_username` just above the `Main` method:

```csharp
private static string _username;
```

This field will be used to store the username of the authenticated user. Once a user is authenticated, their username will be stored in this field, allowing us to utilize it later for setting the session context within our database connection. This approach ensures that every database operation performed during the session can be associated with the authenticated user, leveraging the RLS policy effectively based on the user's identity.

### Create the `Login` Method

Next, below the `Main` method, add the `Login` method to handle user authentication:

```csharp
public static bool Login()
{
    System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break();

    Console.WriteLine("Please login");
    Console.WriteLine();

    Console.Write("Username: ");
    var username = Console.ReadLine();

    Console.Write("Password: ");
    var password = Console.ReadLine();

    Console.WriteLine();

    if (password != "rlsdemo")
    {
        _username = null;
        return false;
    }

    _username = username;
    return true;
}
```

This method prompts the user for their username and password. It then checks if the supplied password matches the hardcoded password "rlsdemo". If the password is correct, the method stores the user's username in the previously added static field `_username`, effectively authenticating them. If the password doesn't match, the method resets `_username` to null, effectively treating the user as anonymous.

By designing the `Login` method this way, we allow the application to run even when a user fails to authenticate properly. This means that, for an anonymous or improperly authenticated user, the application behavior remains consistent with our Row-Level Security (RLS) policy: the "SELECT * FROM Sales" query will not return any results, reflecting the database's RLS restrictions based on user identity. This method gives us a simple yet effective way to integrate user authentication into our application flow.

### Call the `Login` Method

To incorporate our user authentication into the client application, add the following code snippet to the beginning of the `Main` method, right before the call to `DisplayOrders`. This snippet attempts to authenticate the user as soon as the application starts:

```csharp
if (!Login())
{
    Console.WriteLine("Authentication failed; proceeding as anonymous user; press any key to continue");
    Console.ReadKey();
}
```

This code makes a call to the `Login` method you've just added. If the login attempt fails (meaning the `Login` method returns `false`), it displays a message to the user indicating that authentication has failed and the application will proceed with anonymous access. It then waits for the user to press any key before continuing to display the orders.

By adding this login attempt at the start, we ensure that the user's identity (or lack thereof, in the case of a failed login) is established right from the beginning. This setup is crucial for the next steps, where we'll modify the application to use this identity information to set session context in the database, effectively integrating with our Row-Level Security (RLS) policy.

### Set the Session Context

Finally, modify the `OpenSqlConnection` method to set the session context on the database connection. This is crucial for integrating with Row-Level Security (RLS) based on the authenticated user. Add the following code to the `OpenSqlConnection` method, right after the `conn.Open();` line, which opens the database connection, and just before the `return conn;` statement that returns the connection object:

```csharp
if (_username == null)
{
    // user is unauthenticated; return an ordinary open connection
    return conn;
}

// user is authenticated; set the session context on the open connection for RLS
try
{
    using var cmd = new SqlCommand("sp_set_session_context", conn);
    cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@key", "AppUsername");
    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@value", _username);
    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@read_only", 1);

    cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
}
catch (Exception)
{
    conn.Close();
    conn.Dispose();
    throw;
}
```

After opening the connection (`conn.Open()`), the code checks if the user is authenticated by examining the `_username` field. If `_username` is `null`, indicating the user is unauthenticated, it returns the connection as is, which will not set any specific session context. This is the path taken for anonymous users, who won't receive any results from queries due to the RLS policy.

For authenticated users (`_username` is not `null`), the code executes `sp_set_session_context`. This stored procedure sets a session-level context named `AppUsername` to the authenticated username, marking it as read-only for the connection's duration. This session context value (`AppUsername`) must match the key used in your RLS security policy to identify the user, enabling RLS to apply the correct data filtering based on the user's identity.

The `@read_only` parameter is crucially set to `1` (true) to ensure the session context cannot be altered during the connection session, preserving the integrity of the security implementation. If there's an issue setting the session context (caught by the `catch` block), the connection is closed and disposed to prevent any unintended access.

## Review the Final Code

The code in `Program.cs` should now look like this:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data;
using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient;

namespace RLSClient
{
    internal class Program
    {
        private const string ConnStr =
            "data source=.;initial catalog=MyDB;uid=AppLogin;pwd=Big$ecret123;Trust Server Certificate=True;";

        private static string _username;

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break();

            if (!Login())
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Authentication failed; proceeding as anonymous user; press any key to continue");
                Console.ReadKey();
            }
            DisplayOrders();
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to continue");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        public static bool Login()
        {
            System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break();

            Console.WriteLine("Please login");
            Console.WriteLine();

            Console.Write("Username: ");
            var username = Console.ReadLine();

            Console.Write("Password: ");
            var password = Console.ReadLine();

            Console.WriteLine();

            if (password != "rlsdemo")
            {
                _username = null;
                return false;
            }

            _username = username;
            return true;
        }

        public static void DisplayOrders()
        {
            System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break();

            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Order list:");

            using var conn = OpenSqlConnection();

            using var cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
            cmd.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM Sales";

            using var rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
            var count = 0;
            while (rdr.Read())
            {
                count++;
                Console.WriteLine(" " +
                    $"OrderID: {rdr["OrderID"]}; " +
                    $"SalesUsername: {rdr["SalesUsername"]}; " +
                    $"Product: {rdr["Product"]}; " +
                    $"Qty: {rdr["Qty"]}; "
                );
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Total orders: {0}", count);

            conn.Close();
            Console.WriteLine();
        }

        private static SqlConnection OpenSqlConnection()
        {
            var conn = new SqlConnection(ConnStr);
            conn.Open();

            if (_username == null)
            {
                // user is unauthenticated; return an ordinary open connection
                return conn;
            }

            // user is authenticated; set the session context on the open connection for RLS
            try
            {
                using var cmd = new SqlCommand("sp_set_session_context", conn);
                cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
                cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@key", "AppUsername");
                cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@value", _username);
                cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@read_only", 1);

                cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {
                conn.Close();
                conn.Dispose();
                throw;
            }

            return conn;
        }

    }
}
```

## Test the Client Application

Now test the application under three distinct scenarios to observe how RLS policies govern data access based on session context:

1. **Run with Incorrect Password (Anonymous Access):**
   - When prompted for the username and password, intentionally enter an incorrect password.
   - Observe that the application proceeds as an anonymous user, and note that no rows are returned from the `Sales` table query. This result occurs because, without a valid session context, the RLS policy restricts access to the data.

2. **Run as SalesUser1:**
   - Restart the application and this time log in with the username `SalesUser1` and the correct password `rlsdemo`.
   - Upon successful authentication, observe that the application only returns rows associated with `SalesUser1`. This specific filtering is the result of the RLS policy applying the session context (`AppUsername` set to `SalesUser1`), thus ensuring users only access their data.

3. **Run as SalesUser2:**
   - Run the application again, but log in as `SalesUser2` using the correct password `rlsdemo`.
   - Similar to the previous authenticated run, note that only the data rows belonging to `SalesUser2` are returned. Again, this behavior is due to the RLS policy, which dynamically filters the data based on the authenticated user's session context.

These tests vividly demonstrate the powerful integration of session context with RLS policies, ensuring that data access is securely and appropriately constrained according to each user's permissions.




## Using RLS with Entity Framework

In this lab, we demonstrated how to use session context with Row-Level Security (RLS) in a conventional ADO.NET scenario using the `SqlCommand` object. However, this approach can also be integrated with Entity Framework (EF).

Simply override the `OnConfiguring` method in your `DbContext` subclass to call `sp_set_session_context` every time the context is configured. Although Entity Framework is being used for your application data access, you can use conventional ADO.NET to call `sp_set_session_context` in a manner very similar to how we achieved this in our lab:

```csharp
protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("your_connection_string_here");

    var conn = Database.GetDbConnection();
    conn.Open();

    if (_username != null)
    {
        using (var command = conn.CreateCommand())
        {
            command.CommandText = "sp_set_session_context";
            command.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
            command.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@key", "AppUsername"));
            command.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@value", _username));
            command.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@read_only", true));

            command.ExecuteNonQuery();
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- **Opening the Connection:** The `Database.GetDbConnection()` method retrieves the underlying database connection used by the `DbContext`. We explicitly open the connection to ensure it's active before setting the session context.
  
- **Setting Session Context:** We create a command to execute the `sp_set_session_context` stored procedure, passing the `@key`, `@value`, and `@read_only` parameters, similar to our ADO.NET example. This sets the session context for the current connection, thereby applying the RLS policies based on the session context values.

- **Integrating with Your Application:** Replace `"your_connection_string_here"` with your actual database connection string. Also, ensure `_username` contains the authenticated user's username, as it plays a crucial role in setting the session context.

This approach allows Entity Framework applications to utilize SQL Server's Row-Level Security (RLS) feature seamlessly, enabling dynamic row-level access control based on the application's user context.


## Cleanup

To clean up after your Row-Level Security (RLS) lab exercises, run the following SQL commands in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). This will remove the security policy, predicate function, user, login, and table you created during the lab, restoring your database environment to its previous state:

```sql
DROP SECURITY POLICY SalesUserPolicy
DROP FUNCTION SalesUserPredicate
DROP USER AppUser
DROP LOGIN AppLogin
DROP TABLE Sales
```

Running this code ensures that your SQL Server environment is clean and ready for your next set of activities.
