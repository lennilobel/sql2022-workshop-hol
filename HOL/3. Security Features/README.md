# Security Features

This labs in this section dive into several robust security features available in SQL Server 2022, aimed at providing comprehensive data protection and compliance capabilities. As data security becomes increasingly paramount, understanding and implementing these features is critical for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring data integrity.

- **Ledger Tables**: Ledger tables introduce an immutable data structure, enabling you to verify the integrity and history of your data, making it an essential tool for auditing and compliance.
  
- **Dynamic Data Masking**: With Dynamic Data Masking, sensitive data can be obscured from unauthorized access, allowing you to control visibility based on user roles, thereby enhancing data privacy.
  
- **Row-Level Security**: Row-Level Security allows for fine-grained access control, ensuring that users can only access data rows that they are permitted to see, based on customizable security policies.
  
- **Always Encrypted**: Always Encrypted technology ensures that sensitive data remains encrypted both at rest and in transit, offering a high level of protection against unauthorized access and threats.

By understanding and utilizing these security features, you can significantly enhance the security of your SQL Server databases, protecting your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or tampering.
