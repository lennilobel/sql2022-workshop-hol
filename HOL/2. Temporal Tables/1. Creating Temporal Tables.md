# Temporal Tables

Temporal tables, officially referred to as *system-versioned tables*, enable SQL Server to automatically manage historical data. These tables include two specifically defined columns, the "period" columns, which SQL Server populates to track when each row is valid in time. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining an auditable history of data changes over time.

In this demonstration, we will create a new temporal table named `Employee` and define a custom history table called `EmployeeHistory`. The `WITH (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (HISTORY_TABLE = dbo.EmployeeHistory))` clause specifies that system versioning is enabled for the table and designates `EmployeeHistory` as the history table.

## Creating a Temporal Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee
(
    EmployeeId      int PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName       varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    LastName        varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    DepartmentName  varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    ValidFrom       datetime2 GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START NOT NULL, 
    ValidTo         datetime2 GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW END NOT NULL,   
    PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (ValidFrom, ValidTo)
)
WITH (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (HISTORY_TABLE = dbo.EmployeeHistory))
```

In this code, the `PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (ValidFrom, ValidTo)` clause identifies the `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo` columns as the special period columns used by SQL Server to manage the row's validity period. The `SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON` option enables versioning for the table, with changes being tracked in the specified history table `EmployeeHistory`.

## Discovering Temporal and History Tables

Refresh to Object Explorer in SQL Server Management Studio. Note how temporal tables are designated with a special icon, and their associated history tables appear nested beneath them in the tree view.

To view the temporal table and its associated history table in T-SQL, you can query the `sys.tables` system view:

```sql
SELECT
    object_id,
    name,
    temporal_type,
    temporal_type_desc,
    history_table_id
FROM
    sys.tables
WHERE
    object_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.Employee', 'U') OR
    object_id = ( 
        SELECT history_table_id 
        FROM sys.tables
        WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.Employee', 'U')
)
```

This query returns information about the temporal table and its history table, including the `object_id` and the `name` of each table, as well as their `temporal_type_desc` which indicates whether the table is a history table or the main table.

## Deleting a Temporal Table

To clean up and remove the temporal table and its history table, it's necessary to first "decouple" them by turning off system versioning:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF)
DROP TABLE Employee
DROP TABLE EmployeeHistory
```

The `ALTER TABLE Employee SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF)` statement disables system versioning for the `Employee` table, effectively decoupling it from its history table. This allows both the current and history tables to be treated as ordinary (non-temporal) tables, making it possible to delete them. This step is required because direct deletion of a system-versioned temporal table without first disabling system versioning would result in an error.



## Convert an Existing Table to Temporal


In this demonstration, we start by creating and populating the `Employee` table with initial employee records. This step is foundational for transforming the existing table into a temporal table later on. It's important to note that at this stage, the table is an ordinary table, and SQL Server is not tracking changes. Therefore, there is no previous change history recorded for these employees.

### Step 1: Create and Populate the Employee Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee
(
    EmployeeId      int PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName       varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    LastName        varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    DepartmentName  varchar(50) NOT NULL
)

INSERT INTO Employee VALUES
 (1, 'Ken',     'Sanchez',       'Executive'),
 (2, 'Terri',   'Duffy',         'Engineering'),
 (3, 'Roberto', 'Tamburello',    'Engineering'),
 (4, 'Rob',     'Walters',       'Engineering'),
 (5, 'Gail',    'Erickson',      'Engineering'),
 (6, 'Jossef',  'Goldberg',      'Engineering')

SELECT * FROM Employee
```

This step focuses on establishing the `Employee` table and inserting six records into it. These records represent the employees at their current state. Given that the table is not yet a temporal table, any changes made to the employee records up to this point have not been recorded, meaning there is no historical data available for these records. This absence of historical data will change once we convert this table into a temporal table, allowing us to track all future modifications to the employee records.

### Step 2: Execute two ALTER TABLE Statements

When converting an existing table to a temporal table, specific steps must be followed to adhere to SQL Server's requirements for temporal tables. The process involves adding system-time period columns and enabling system versioning. Here's how it's done:

1. **Adding System-Time Period Columns**: Temporal tables require two datetime2 columns to record the row's valid time period. These columns are added to the existing table with default constraints. Since the table already contains rows, a default value must be provided for these new columns. In this context, the `ValidFrom` column is set to the earliest possible time (`1900-01-01 00:00:00.0000000`), and the `ValidTo` column is set to the latest possible time (`9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999`). These extremes represent the valid period for the existing rows from the beginning to the end of time, essentially marking them as always valid until a change occurs.

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee ADD
    ValidFrom datetime2 GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START NOT NULL DEFAULT CAST('1900-01-01 00:00:00.0000000' AS datetime2),
    ValidTo   datetime2 GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW END   NOT NULL DEFAULT CAST('9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999' AS datetime2),
    PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (ValidFrom, ValidTo)
```

2. **Enabling System Versioning**: The next step involves enabling system versioning on the table, which turns it into a temporal table. This action automatically creates a history table (in this case, `dbo.EmployeeHistory`) with an identical schema to store the historical data. The history table's name should be specified explicitly, or it will be named by default after the table's internal object ID, which is awkward and unintuitive. This step requires the table to have a primary key and defined system-time period columns.

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee 
    SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (HISTORY_TABLE = dbo.EmployeeHistory))
```

Refresh the Object Explorer in SSMS and note how the `Employee` table is now designated as a temporal table, and is coupled with an `EmployeeHistory` table which appears nested beneath it.

At this point, the history table (`EmployeeHistory`) starts out empty because no changes have been made to the `Employee` table yet. Here are two queries to demonstrate this:

```sql
-- Show current state of the Employee table
SELECT * FROM Employee

-- Show that the EmployeeHistory table is initially empty
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHistory
```

These steps illustrate how SQL Server facilitates the transformation of a standard table into a temporal one, allowing for the automatic tracking of historical data changes without loss of existing data.

## Schema Changes

Schema changes within SQL Server temporal tables, especially the addition or deletion of columns, illustrate the seamless synchronization between the primary table and its history table. This synchronization ensures the history table mirrors the schema of the primary table, preserving the integrity and consistency of temporal queries over time. This example demonstrates how adding or removing a column from the primary table (`Employee`) is automatically replicated in the history table (`EmployeeHistory`), under normal circumstances.

1. **Adding a Column:**
   When a new column, `RegionID`, is added to the `Employee` table, SQL Server automatically updates the `EmployeeHistory` table to include this new column. This action maintains schema consistency across the primary and history tables, enabling the history table to continue capturing the complete state of each row over time, including the newly added column.
   ```sql
   -- Add a column (gets added to history table automatically)
   ALTER TABLE Employee ADD RegionID int NULL
   
   SELECT * FROM Employee
   SELECT * FROM EmployeeHistory
   ```

2. **Deleting a Column:**
   Similarly, when the `RegionID` column is removed from the `Employee` table, SQL Server ensures the column is also dropped from the `EmployeeHistory` table. This synchronization prevents schema mismatches that could complicate temporal queries and analyses. By automatically applying schema changes made to the primary table to the history table, SQL Server simplifies the management of temporal tables.
   ```sql
   -- Drop a column (gets dropped from history table automatically)
   ALTER TABLE Employee DROP COLUMN RegionID
   
   SELECT * FROM Employee
   SELECT * FROM EmployeeHistory
   ```

It's important to note the exceptions to this automatic synchronization. Certain column types, such as IDENTITY and computed columns, cannot be directly added to the history table due to their nature. For these cases, the system versioning must be temporarily disabled, changes applied manually to both tables to ensure consistency, and then system versioning re-enabled.
