# Temporal Tables -- Point-in-Time Queries

Temporal queries in SQL Server enable us to navigate through time, revisiting a table's state at various times in the past. These "point-in-time" queries can be particularly insightful for auditing, data recovery, and historical analysis.

## Running Point-In-Time Queries

 Here's how to create point-in-time queries.
 
 1.  **Current Data Query**:
   - Retrieves the present state of the **Employee** table, showing current entries. Here, the "point-in-time" is right now.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   This displays the latest information, such as "Gabriel Erickson" in the "Executive" department, and no data for the deleted employee "Terri Duffy" (Employee ID 2).

2. **Point-in-Time Query as of December 1, 2018**:
   - Fetches data as it existed on December 1, 2018, by merging current and historical data to reflect the table's state at that point.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2018-12-01' ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   This reveals "Gabriel Erickson" in the "Support" department, which was the department change at that time. And we've still not queried far back enough in time to recover the deleted employee.

3. **Point-in-Time Query as of November 15, 2018**:
   - Retrieves the table's state on November 15, 2018, including previously deleted or updated records.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2018-11-15' ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   At this time, "Gabriel Erickson" was in "Engineering", and "Terri Duffy" (Employee ID 2) is still present, having been deleted after this date.

4. **Point-in-Time Query as of October 10, 2018**:
   - Shows the table's state on October 10, 2018, revealing earlier states of current records.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2018-10-10' ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   This query unveils "Gail Erickson" in "Engineering", indicating the initial name and department before subsequent changes.

5. **Point-in-Time Query as of October 1, 2018**:
   - Attempts to access the table's state before any records were entered.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2018-10-01' ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   This results in no data, signifying that the table was empty or the records had not yet been created.

Each query uses `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` to perform a temporal query, which SQL Server executes by combining the current table with its history table. This mechanism allows for an integrated view of the data at specified historical points, effectively making the database a time machine. By specifying different dates, we can observe the evolution of data, including updates, deletions, and the initial state before any modifications. This capability is invaluable for applications requiring an audit trail, historical data analysis, or undoing unintended changes.




## Matching on Exact Point-In-Time Boundaries

This demo delves into the behavior of temporal queries when the specified point in time (`AS OF`) exactly matches the boundary between two historical states of a row. Here's how SQL Server processes these temporal queries, particularly focusing on the `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo` timestamps:

1. **Identifying Boundary Cases**:
   - First, we examine the history table to identify rows with `ValidFrom` or `ValidTo` timestamps that precisely match a boundary condition. In this case, we're looking at '2018-11-18 04:26:00'.
   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM EmployeeHistory
     WHERE ValidFrom = '2018-11-18 04:26:00' OR ValidTo = '2018-11-18 04:26:00'
     ORDER BY EmployeeId, ValidFrom
   ```
   This query finds two rows in the history table for Employee ID 5, where one row ends and another begins at the exact time of '2018-11-18 04:26:00'.

2. **Querying at the Boundary Time**:
   - Running a point-in-time query exactly at the boundary (`'2018-11-18 04:26:00'`) demonstrates that SQL Server matches on the `ValidFrom` time, not `ValidTo`.
   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2018-11-18 04:26:00'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
     ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   The result is the version of Employee ID 5 with the department name "Support", indicating the state of the data as it became valid exactly at '2018-11-18 04:26:00'.

3. **Querying Just Before the Boundary**:
   - Adjusting the point-in-time query to one second before the boundary (`'2018-11-18 04:25:59'`) retrieves the earlier version of the data.
   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2018-11-18 04:25:59'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
     ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   This time, the query returns the earlier version of Employee ID 5, where the department name was "Engineering". This version was valid up until '2018-11-18 04:26:00', illustrating the inclusive nature of `ValidFrom` and the exclusive nature of `ValidTo`.

These demonstrations clarify that the `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` temporal query condition inclusively matches rows based on the `ValidFrom` timestamp. When a query's specified point in time aligns exactly with the boundary between two historical states of a row, SQL Server opts to return the row that just became valid at that timestamp, effectively favoring `ValidFrom` over `ValidTo`. This behavior ensures precise and predictable outcomes when exploring data history, particularly at the precise moments of transition between historical states.





## FROM vs. BETWEEN

Exploring temporal tables in SQL Server further, we delve into the nuances between using `FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM A TO B` versus `FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN A AND B`. These clauses are integral for querying historical data within a specified time range, offering insights into data's evolution over time. Specifically, we'll examine their behavior with respect to exact boundary matches using Employee ID 5 as our focus.

1. **Equivalent Queries with FROM and BETWEEN**:
   When querying without hitting the exact boundary of `ValidFrom`, both `FROM ... TO` and `BETWEEN ... AND` return identical results.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM '2018-11-02' TO '2018-12-03 08:59:59'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
   
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN '2018-11-02' AND '2018-12-03 08:59:59'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
   ```
   These queries are identical, and both retrieve versions of Employee ID 5 valid at any time between November 2, 2018, precisely one second before December 3, 2018, 09:00:00.

2. **Behavior Difference on Exact Boundary**:
   However, when the upper bound of the time range exactly matches a `ValidFrom` value, `FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN` includes an additional row that represents the state of the data at the boundary.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM '2018-11-02' TO '2018-12-03 09:00:00'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
   
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN '2018-11-02' AND '2018-12-03 09:00:00'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
   ```
   The first query, using `FROM ... TO`, does not include the version of Employee ID 5 that became valid exactly at '2018-12-03 09:00:00'. In contrast, the second query, using `BETWEEN`, includes this version, demonstrating `BETWEEN`'s inclusivity of the upper boundary.

This distinction is pivotal for scenarios requiring precision in temporal data analysis. While both clauses offer powerful means to explore historical data, understanding their differences ensures the accuracy of temporal queries, especially when boundary conditions are of interest. The `BETWEEN` clause's inclusivity on the upper boundary can be particularly useful when it's essential to capture every possible change within the specified range, including the exact start of a new version.




## CONTAINED IN

In SQL Server's exploration of temporal tables, the `FOR SYSTEM_TIME CONTAINED IN (A, B)` clause introduces a nuanced approach to querying historical data, distinct from the `FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM A TO B` syntax. This difference hinges on the inclusivity of the specified time boundaries A and B, affecting the rows returned based on their period of validity within the temporal table. Here, we focus on Employee ID 5 to illustrate these nuances.

1. **FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM A TO B**:
   This query returns rows if their valid period overlaps with any part of the time range specified by A and B. It includes rows where either `ValidFrom` or `ValidTo` falls within the specified range, thus capturing rows that partially overlap with the time frame.
   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM '2018-11-02' TO '2018-12-04'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
   ```
   This retrieves all versions of Employee ID 5 that have any part of their valid period within November 2, 2018, to December 4, 2018.

2. **FOR SYSTEM_TIME CONTAINED IN (A, B)**:
   Contrary to `FROM A TO B`, the `CONTAINED IN (A, B)` variant returns rows only if their entire valid period is within the time boundaries A and B. This means both `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo` must fall within the specified range for a row to be included.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME CONTAINED IN ('2018-11-02', '2018-12-04')
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
   ```
   This query will return versions of Employee ID 5 where the entire valid period is encompassed between November 2, 2018, and December 4, 2018, excluding any versions that only partially overlap with this range.

The `CONTAINED IN` clause is particularly useful when the requirement is to isolate records that existed entirely within a specific timeframe, without including records that were valid only partially within that range. This is critical for analyses focused on data states that were consistently present through an entire period, offering a more stringent criterion than `FROM A TO B`, which accommodates any degree of overlap with the specified timeframe.








## Cleanup

To clean up and remove the temporal tables created during the previous labs, it's necessary to first disable system versioning for each table. This step decouples the primary table from its associated history table, allowing both to be treated as standard, non-temporal tables. Once system versioning is turned off, both the primary table and its history table can be deleted without any constraints imposed by the temporal setup.

- Disable system versioning and delete the `Employee` and `EmployeeHistory` tables:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF)
DROP TABLE Employee
DROP TABLE EmployeeHistory
```

- Disable system versioning and delete the `Employee2` and `Employee2History` tables:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee2 SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF)
DROP TABLE Employee2
DROP TABLE Employee2History
```

This cleanup process highlights the importance of disabling system versioning before attempting to delete a temporal table.
