# Running Point-in-Time Queries on Temporal Tables

The true magic of temporal tables lies in SQL Server's ability to navigate through time, revisiting a table's state at various times in the past. This is achieved by writing "point-in-time" queries, and can be particularly insightful for auditing, data recovery, and historical analysis.

## Using FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF for Point-In-Time Queries

 Here's how to create point-in-time queries.
 
- **Current Data Query**

   Retrieves the present state of the **Employee** table, showing current entries. This ordinary query does not include `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF`, and so the "point-in-time" is right now.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   This displays the latest information, such as "Gabriel Erickson" in the "Executive" department, and no data for the deleted employee "Terri Duffy" (Employee ID 2).

- **Point-in-Time Query as of December 1, 2018**
   Fetches data as it existed on December 1, 2018, by merging current and historical data to reflect the table's state at that point.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2018-12-01' ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   This reveals "Gabriel Erickson" in the "Support" department, which was the department change at that time. And we've still not queried far back enough in time to recover the deleted employee.

- **Point-in-Time Query as of November 15, 2018**
   Retrieves the table's state on November 15, 2018, including previously deleted or updated records.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2018-11-15' ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   At this time, "Gabriel Erickson" was in "Engineering", and "Terri Duffy" (Employee ID 2) is still present, having been deleted after this date.

- **Point-in-Time Query as of October 10, 2018**
   Shows the table's state on October 10, 2018, revealing earlier states of current records.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2018-10-10' ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   This query unveils "Gail Erickson" in "Engineering", indicating the initial name and department before subsequent changes. This actually reflects the original state of the `Employee` table before any changes were made.

- **Point-in-Time Query as of October 1, 2018**:
   Attempts to access the table's state before any records were entered.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2018-10-01' ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   This results in no data, signifying that the table was empty or the records had not yet been created.

These queries use `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` to perform a temporal query, which SQL Server executes by combining the current table with its history table, and selecting the correct row version for the specified point in time. This mechanism allows for an integrated view of the data at specified historical points, effectively making the database a time machine. By specifying different dates, we can observe the evolution of data, including updates, deletions, and the initial state before any modifications. This capability is invaluable for applications requiring an audit trail, historical data analysis, or undoing unintended changes.

## Matching on Exact Point-In-Time Boundaries

The next example demonstrates the behavior of temporal queries when the point in time specified with `AS OF` exactly matches the boundary between two historical states of a row; that is, when querying for a point in time that matches the `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo` dates of two consecutive rows.

- **Identifying Boundary Cases**
   Examine the history table to identify rows with `ValidFrom` or `ValidTo` timestamps that precisely match a boundary condition. In this case, we're looking at **2018-11-18 04:26:00**.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM EmployeeHistory
     WHERE ValidFrom = '2018-11-18 04:26:00' OR ValidTo = '2018-11-18 04:26:00'
     ORDER BY EmployeeId, ValidFrom
   ```
   This query finds two rows in the history table for Employee ID 5, where one row ends and another begins at the exact time of **2018-11-18 04:26:00**.

- **Querying at the Boundary Time**
   Running a point-in-time query exactly at the boundary `2018-11-18 04:26:00` demonstrates that SQL Server matches on the `ValidFrom` time, not `ValidTo`.
  
   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2018-11-18 04:26:00'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
     ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   The result is the version of Employee ID 5 with the department name "Support", indicating the state of the data as it became valid exactly at '2018-11-18 04:26:00'.

- **Querying Just Before the Boundary**:
   Adjusting the point-in-time query to one second before the boundary (**2018-11-18 04:25:59**) retrieves the earlier version of the data.
   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2018-11-18 04:25:59'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
     ORDER BY EmployeeId
   ```
   This time, the query returns the earlier version of Employee ID 5, where the department name was "Engineering". This version was valid up until **2018-11-18 04:26:00**, illustrating the inclusive nature of `ValidFrom` and the exclusive nature of `ValidTo`.

## FROM and BETWEEN

Using `FOR SYSTEM TIME AS OF` gives you a precise point-in-time view of a temporal table. But you can also use `FOR SYSTEM TIME FROM A TO B` or `FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN A AND B` to retrieve multiple versions of the same row within the specified time range of A and B. Although these two variations often yield the same result, there is a subtle difference in behavior in one particular scenario that we'll examine next.

Specifically, we'll examine their behaviors with respect to exact boundary matches using Employee ID 5 as our focus.

- **Equivalent Queries with FROM and BETWEEN**
   When querying without hitting the exact boundary of `ValidFrom`, both `FROM ... TO` and `BETWEEN ... AND` return identical results.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM '2018-11-02' TO '2018-12-03 08:59:59'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
   
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN '2018-11-02' AND '2018-12-03 08:59:59'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
   ```
   These queries are identical, and both retrieve versions of Employee ID 5 valid at any time between November 2, 2018, precisely one second before December 3, 2018, 09:00:00.

- **Behavior Difference on Exact Boundary**
   However, when the upper bound of the time range exactly matches a `ValidFrom` value, `FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN` includes an additional row that represents the state of the data at the boundary. In this same scenario, `FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM` does not include the additional boundary row matching on `ValidFrom`.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM '2018-11-02' TO '2018-12-03 09:00:00'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
   
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN '2018-11-02' AND '2018-12-03 09:00:00'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
   ```
   The first query, using `FROM ... TO`, does not include the version of Employee ID 5 that became valid exactly at **2018-12-03 09:00:00**. In contrast, the second query, using `BETWEEN`, includes this version, demonstrating `BETWEEN`'s inclusivity of the upper boundary.

This distinction can be pivotal for scenarios requiring precision in temporal data analysis. While both clauses offer powerful means to explore historical data within a specified time period, understanding their differences ensures the accuracy of temporal queries, especially when boundary conditions are of interest. The `BETWEEN` clause's inclusivity on the upper boundary can be particularly useful when it's essential to capture every possible change within the specified range, including the exact start of a new version.

## CONTAINED IN

There is another temporal range option available, using the `FOR SYSTEM_TIME CONTAINED IN (A, B)` clause. This clause introduces a nuanced approach to querying historical data, distinct from the `FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM A TO B` or `FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN A AND B` syntax. This difference hinges on the inclusivity of the specified time boundaries A and B, where both period columns of a row version must be entirely contained within the specified boundaries. Let's focus on Employee ID 5 to illustrate the concept.

- **FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM A TO B**
   This query returns rows if their valid period overlaps with any part of the time range specified by A and B. It includes rows where either `ValidFrom` or `ValidTo` falls within the specified range, thus capturing rows that partially overlap with the specified time frame.
   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM '2018-11-02' TO '2018-12-04'
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
   ```
   This retrieves the three versions of Employee ID 5 that have any part of their valid period within November 2, 2018, to December 4, 2018.

- **FOR SYSTEM_TIME CONTAINED IN (A, B)**:
   Contrary to `FROM A TO B`, the `CONTAINED IN (A, B)` variant returns rows only if their entire valid period is within the time boundaries A and B. This means both `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo` must fall within the specified range for a row to be included.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
     FROM Employee FOR SYSTEM_TIME CONTAINED IN ('2018-11-02', '2018-12-04')
     WHERE EmployeeId = 5
   ```
   This query will return versions of Employee ID 5 where the entire valid period is encompassed between November 2, 2018, and December 4, 2018, excluding any versions that only partially overlap with this range. In our sample dataset, there is only one version of Employee ID satisfies this condition, which is the version that was valid from **2018-11-18 04:26** through **2018-12-03 09:00**.

The `CONTAINED IN` clause is particularly useful when the requirement is to isolate records that existed entirely within a specific timeframe, without including records that were valid only partially within that range. This is critical for analyses focused on data states that were consistently present through an entire period, offering a more stringent criterion than `FROM` or `BETWEEN`, which accommodate any degree of overlap with the specified timeframe.

## Cleanup

To clean up and remove the temporal tables created during the previous labs, it's necessary to first disable system versioning for each table. This step decouples the primary table from its associated history table, allowing both to be treated as standard, non-temporal tables. Once system versioning is turned off, both the primary table and its history table can be deleted without any constraints imposed by the temporal setup.

- Disable system versioning and delete the `Employee` and `EmployeeHistory` tables:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF)
DROP TABLE Employee
DROP TABLE EmployeeHistory
```

- Disable system versioning and delete the `Employee2` and `Employee2History` tables:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee2 SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF)
DROP TABLE Employee2
DROP TABLE Employee2History
```

This cleanup process highlights the need to disable system versioning before attempting to delete a temporal table.
