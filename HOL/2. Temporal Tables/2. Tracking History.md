# Tracking History in Temporal Tables

In this lab, we explore how temporal tables track changes over time by updating and deleting records from an existing temporal table, and then examining the generated history. Temporal tables maintain a history of data changes in a separate history table, enabling us to view data as it existed at any point in time.

Continue working in the same query window as the previous lab, where we created the `Employee` temporal table.

## Capturing Updates and Deletes to History

Run this SQL code to perform some updates and a deletion in the `Employee` temporal table we created in the previous lab, with a two second delay between each change:

```sql
-- Update employee ID 5 three times (change the FirstName, then change the DepartmentName twice, two seconds apart)
UPDATE Employee SET FirstName = 'Gabriel' WHERE EmployeeId = 5
WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:02'
UPDATE Employee SET DepartmentName = 'Support' WHERE EmployeeId = 5
WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:02'
UPDATE Employee SET DepartmentName = 'Executive' WHERE EmployeeId = 5
WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:02'
-- Now delete employee ID 2
DELETE Employee WHERE EmployeeId = 2

-- History table shows the changes
SELECT * FROM Employee
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHistory ORDER BY EmployeeId, ValidFrom
```

The main table shows that Employee ID 2 is deleted, and reflects the latest changes for Employee ID 5.

In the history table, observe the following:

- Three previous versions of Employee ID 5 are preserved, each reflecting the changes made with each update statement. These versions show changes to both the `FirstName` and `DepartmentName` columns.
- The `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo` columns demarcate the exact time frame for which each version of the record was valid. Importantly, these time frames align seamlessly between consecutive versions across both the main table and the history table. This ensures there are no gaps or overlaps between consecutive versions, and is critical for accurately identifying the correct version of each row at any point in time.
- The deleted record for Employee ID 2 is also preserved in the history table. This ensures that even though the record has been removed from the current table, its existence and the period it was valid for are still traceable in the history table.

Now let's cleanup once more, and delete the Employee table along with the history table.

```sql
-- Disable SYSTEM_VERSIONING before cleanup
ALTER TABLE Employee SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF)

-- Cleanup: drop the tables
DROP TABLE Employee
DROP TABLE EmployeeHistory
```

Remember, disabling `SYSTEM_VERSIONING` decouples the temporal table from its history table, allowing you to manage them as separate, ordinary tables. This step is crucial before deleting temporal tables and their associated history tables, as SQL Server enforces the relationship between them while `SYSTEM_VERSIONING` is enabled.

## Pre-populating Temporal History

Now let's see how you can pre-populate temporal history. We'll simulate the same set of changes as the previous example, but with longer spans of time between changes than just two seconds apart.

First, we establish two standard tables:

- `Employee`: Acts as the current state table.
- `EmployeeHistory`: Serves as the historical changes record.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee
(
    EmployeeId      int PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName       varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    LastName        varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    DepartmentName  varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    ValidFrom       datetime2 NOT NULL, 
    ValidTo         datetime2 NOT NULL
)

CREATE TABLE EmployeeHistory
(
    EmployeeId      int NOT NULL,
    FirstName       varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    LastName        varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    DepartmentName  varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    ValidFrom       datetime2 NOT NULL, 
    ValidTo         datetime2 NOT NULL
)
```

Now populate both tables to reflect the same data and changes we saw in the previous example, except that the gaps in time between changes are being artificially set to longer periods of time than just two seconds.

```sql
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES
 (1, 'Ken',        'Sanchez',       'Executive',    '2018-10-07 08:33:00', '9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999'),
 (3, 'Roberto',    'Tamburello',    'Engineering',  '2018-10-07 08:33:00', '9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999'),
 (4, 'Rob',        'Walters',       'Engineering',  '2018-10-07 08:33:00', '9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999'),
 (5, 'Gabriel',    'Erickson',      'Executive',    '2018-12-03 09:00:00', '9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999'),
 (6, 'Jossef',     'Goldberg',      'Engineering',  '2018-10-07 08:33:00', '9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999')

INSERT INTO EmployeeHistory VALUES
 (2, 'Terri',      'Duffy',         'Engineering',  '2018-10-07 08:33:00', '2018-11-16 00:00:00'),  -- deleted 11/16
 (5, 'Gabriel',    'Erickson',      'Support',      '2018-11-18 04:26:00', '2018-12-03 09:00:00'),
 (5, 'Gabriel',    'Erickson',      'Engineering',  '2018-11-01 11:59:00', '2018-11-18 04:26:00'),
 (5, 'Gail',       'Erickson',      'Engineering',  '2018-10-07 08:33:00', '2018-11-01 11:59:00')
```

(Notice that we're using datetime values rounded to the minute, just to make it easier to view data in this example. As you saw in previous examples, SQL Server stores datetime values in the period columns at the finest level of granularity supported by the `datetime2` data type, which is precise down to seven digits of fractional seconds.)

In the main `Employee` table, Employee ID 2 is missing because it was "deleted," and its record exists only within the `EmployeeHistory` table, marking its removal from the active data set. Observe this by querying both tables:

```sql
-- History table shows the changes
SELECT * FROM Employee
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHistory ORDER BY EmployeeId, ValidFrom
```

Now we'll couple the tables together to convert this to a temporal table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee
 ADD PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (ValidFrom,ValidTo)

ALTER TABLE Employee SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (
    HISTORY_TABLE = dbo.EmployeeHistory,
    DATA_CONSISTENCY_CHECK = ON)
)
```

Now we're ready to run some point-in-time queries on this data, which you'll explore in the next lab. So keep this query window open as you continue on.
