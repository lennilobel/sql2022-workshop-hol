# Temporal Tables

## Tracking History in Temporal Tables

In this demo, we explore how temporal tables track changes over time by updating and deleting records from an existing temporal table, and then examining the generated history. Temporal tables maintain a history of data changes in a separate history table, enabling us to view data as it existed at any point in time.

Here's the SQL code that simulates updates and deletions:

```sql
-- Update employee ID 5 three times (change the FirstName, then change the DepartmentName twice, two seconds apart)
UPDATE Employee SET FirstName = 'Gabriel' WHERE EmployeeId = 5
WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:02'
UPDATE Employee SET DepartmentName = 'Support' WHERE EmployeeId = 5
WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:02'
UPDATE Employee SET DepartmentName = 'Executive' WHERE EmployeeId = 5
WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:02'
-- Now delete employee ID 2
DELETE Employee WHERE EmployeeId = 2

-- History table shows the changes
SELECT * FROM Employee
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHistory ORDER BY EmployeeId, ValidFrom
```

The main table shows that Employee ID 2 is deleted, and reflects the latest changes for Employee ID 5.

In the history table, we observe the following:

- Three previous versions of the employee record are preserved, each reflecting the changes made with each update statement. These versions showcase changes to both the `FirstName` and `DepartmentName` attributes.
- The `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo` columns demarcate the exact time frame for which each version of the record was valid. Importantly, these time frames align seamlessly, ensuring there are no gaps or overlaps between consecutive versions. This seamless alignment is critical for accurately representing the history of data changes.
- The deleted record for Employee ID 2 is also preserved in the history table. This ensures that even though the record has been removed from the current table, its existence and the period it was valid for are still traceable in the history table.

This demonstrates the power of temporal tables in SQL Server 2022 for maintaining comprehensive historical records of data changes, allowing for accurate back-in-time queries and audits.

Now let's cleanup once more, and delete the Employee table along with the history table.


```sql
-- Disable SYSTEM_VERSIONING before cleanup
ALTER TABLE Employee SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF)

-- Cleanup: drop the tables
DROP TABLE Employee
DROP TABLE EmployeeHistory
```

Remember, disabling `SYSTEM_VERSIONING` decouples the temporal table from its history table, allowing you to manage them as separate, ordinary tables. This step is crucial before deleting temporal tables and their associated history tables, as SQL Server enforces the relationship between them while `SYSTEM_VERSIONING` is enabled.





## Pre-populating Temporal History

This demonstration showcases the transformation of ordinary tables into a temporal system, uniquely pre-populating the history with time-spaced changes for a more realistic temporal table functionality.

First, we establish two standard tables:

- **Employee**: Acts as the current state table.
- **EmployeeHistory**: Serves as the historical changes record.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee
(
    EmployeeId      int PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName       varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    LastName        varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    DepartmentName  varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    ValidFrom       datetime2 NOT NULL, 
    ValidTo         datetime2 NOT NULL
)

CREATE TABLE EmployeeHistory
(
    EmployeeId      int NOT NULL,
    FirstName       varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    LastName        varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    DepartmentName  varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    ValidFrom       datetime2 NOT NULL, 
    ValidTo         datetime2 NOT NULL
)
```

Both tables are then populated to reflect the same data and changes we saw in the previous demo, except that the gaps in time between changes are being artificially set to longer periods of time than just two seconds.

```sql
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES
 (1, 'Ken',        'Sanchez',       'Executive',    '2018-10-07 08:33:00', '9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999'),
 (3, 'Roberto',    'Tamburello',    'Engineering',  '2018-10-07 08:33:00', '9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999'),
 (4, 'Rob',        'Walters',       'Engineering',  '2018-10-07 08:33:00', '9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999'),
 (5, 'Gabriel',    'Erickson',      'Executive',    '2018-12-03 09:00:00', '9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999'),
 (6, 'Jossef',     'Goldberg',      'Engineering',  '2018-10-07 08:33:00', '9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999')

INSERT INTO EmployeeHistory VALUES
 (2, 'Terri',      'Duffy',         'Engineering',  '2018-10-07 08:33:00', '2018-11-16 00:00:00'),  -- deleted 11/16
 (5, 'Gabriel',    'Erickson',      'Support',      '2018-11-18 04:26:00', '2018-12-03 09:00:00'),
 (5, 'Gabriel',    'Erickson',      'Engineering',  '2018-11-01 11:59:00', '2018-11-18 04:26:00'),
 (5, 'Gail',       'Erickson',      'Engineering',  '2018-10-07 08:33:00', '2018-11-01 11:59:00')
```

Noticeably, Employee ID 2 is absent from the **Employee** table because it was deleted, and its record exists only within the **EmployeeHistory** table, marking its removal from the active data set. Observe this by querying the tables:

```sql
-- History table shows the changes
SELECT * FROM Employee
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHistory ORDER BY EmployeeId, ValidFrom
```

Now we'll couple the tables together to convert this to a temporal table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee
 ADD PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (ValidFrom,ValidTo)

ALTER TABLE Employee SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (
    HISTORY_TABLE = dbo.EmployeeHistory,
    DATA_CONSISTENCY_CHECK = ON)
)
```

This process underscores SQL Server's temporal table capabilities, ensuring each data record's life span is meticulously recorded. Through period columns `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo`, SQL Server affords a robust framework for managing and analyzing data changes over extended durations, highlighting its strengths in maintaining historical data integrity and traceability.
