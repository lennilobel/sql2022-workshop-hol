## Exploring GENERATE_SERIES in SQL Server 2022

SQL Server 2022 introduces the `GENERATE_SERIES` function, a powerful tool that simplifies the generation of sequences of numbers, including integer and decimal series, as well as date and time ranges. This function eliminates the need for complex workarounds like recursive CTEs or auxiliary number tables for sequence generation, streamlining data analysis and manipulation tasks.

### Transition from Recursive CTEs to GENERATE_SERIES

**Previous Method: Recursive CTE for Sequence Generation**

```sql
WITH GenerateSeriesCte(value) AS 
(
    SELECT 1 UNION ALL 
    SELECT value + 1 FROM GenerateSeriesCte WHERE value < 1000
)
SELECT value = value FROM GenerateSeriesCte
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 1000)
```

Using recursive CTEs to generate sequences can be verbose and inefficient, especially for larger sequences.

**New Method: Using GENERATE_SERIES**

```sql
-- Ensure the database compatibility level is set for SQL Server 2022 to use GENERATE_SERIES
SELECT compatibility_level FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'AdventureWorks2019'
ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2019 SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = 160
```

The compatibility level of the AdventureWorks2019 database needs to be updated to 160 (SQL Server 2022) to utilize `GENERATE_SERIES`. This is a crucial step because `GENERATE_SERIES` is a feature introduced in SQL Server 2022, and attempting to use it in databases set to a lower compatibility level will result in errors.

**Examples of GENERATE_SERIES**

- **Generating a simple range from 1 to 10:**

    ```sql
    SELECT value
    FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1, 10)
    ```

- **Creating a series with a step value, from 1 to 50, stepping by 5:**

    ```sql
    SELECT value
    FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1, 50, 5)
    ```

- **Generating a decimal series from 0.0 to 1.0 with a step of 0.1:**

    ```sql
    DECLARE @start decimal(2, 1) = 0.0
    DECLARE @stop decimal(2, 1) = 1.0
    DECLARE @step decimal(2, 1) = 0.1
    
    SELECT value
    FROM GENERATE_SERIES(@start, @stop, @step)
    ```

- **Creating a series of dates:**

    ```sql
    DECLARE @StartOn date = '2023-02-05'
    DECLARE @EndOn date = '2023-11-15'
    
    DECLARE @DayCount int = DATEDIFF(DAY, @StartOn, @EndOn)
    
    SELECT
    TheDate = DATEADD(DAY, value, @StartOn)
    FROM
    GENERATE_SERIES(0, @DayCount)
    ```

## Advanced Usage of GENERATE_SERIES in SQL Server

SQL Server 2022 introduces the `GENERATE_SERIES` function, eliminating the need for cumbersome methods of generating sequences, such as numbers tables or recursive CTEs. This function is particularly useful for creating a series of numbers, dates, or times in a more streamlined and efficient manner. Here, we explore its application in generating a contiguous series of date/time values to address common data reporting challenges.

### Scenario: Reporting on Sales Data with Unpopulated Intervals

Consider a scenario where sales data is recorded at various times throughout a day, but not every hour is guaranteed to have sales. Traditional aggregation methods like `GROUP BY` might omit hours with no sales, potentially skewing analysis or reporting.

### Step 1: Setup Sales Data Table

First, we create and populate a `Sales` table with sample sales data:

```sql
USE MyDB

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Sales

CREATE TABLE Sales
(
    OrderDateTime    datetime,
    Total            decimal(12,2)
)

INSERT Sales(OrderDateTime, Total) VALUES
    ('2022-05-01 09:35', 21000),
    ('2022-05-01 09:47', 30000),
    ...
    ('2022-05-01 15:51', 21800)
```

### Step 2: Traditional GROUP BY Query

Using a `GROUP BY` to aggregate sales per hour:

```sql
DECLARE @Start datetime = '2022-05-01 09:00'
DECLARE @End   datetime = '2022-05-01 17:00'

WITH SalesAtHourCte AS (
    SELECT
        Total,
        OrderHour = DATEADD(HOUR, DATEDIFF(HOUR, @Start, OrderDateTime), @Start) 
    FROM
        Sales
    WHERE
        OrderDateTime >= @Start AND OrderDateTime <  @End
)
SELECT
    OrderHour,
    HourlySales = SUM(Total)  
FROM
    SalesAtHourCte
GROUP BY
    OrderHour
```

This approach, however, does not account for hours with zero sales.

### Step 3: Incorporating GENERATE_SERIES for Comprehensive Coverage

To ensure every hour within the business day is accounted for, even those without sales:

```sql
DECLARE @Start datetime = '2022-05-01 09:00'
DECLARE @End   datetime = '2022-05-01 17:00'

WITH HoursSeriesCte(OrderHour) AS
(
    SELECT
        DATEADD(HOUR, gs.value, @Start)
    FROM
        GENERATE_SERIES(0, DATEDIFF(HOUR, @Start, @End) - 1) AS gs
)
SELECT
    hs.OrderHour,
    HourlySales = COALESCE(SUM(Total),0)
FROM
    HoursSeriesCte AS hs
    LEFT JOIN Sales AS s ON DATE_BUCKET(HOUR, 1, s.OrderDateTime) = hs.OrderHour
GROUP BY
    hs.OrderHour
```

### Key Takeaways

- **Comprehensive Reporting:** This approach ensures that the report covers every hour within the specified range, displaying zeros for hours without sales, thus providing a complete view of business activity.
- **Efficiency and Simplicity:** `GENERATE_SERIES` simplifies sequence generation, making it more straightforward to create a series of date/time values for interval-based reporting.
- **Enhanced Data Analysis:** By incorporating every hour in the report, businesses gain a clearer understanding of their sales patterns, facilitating better decision-making.

This advanced usage of `GENERATE_SERIES`, combined with `DATE_BUCKET`, showcases SQL Server 2022's capabilities in enhancing data manipulation and reporting tasks, offering a more refined and comprehensive approach to handling temporal data.
