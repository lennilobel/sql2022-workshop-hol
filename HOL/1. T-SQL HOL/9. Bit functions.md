# Bit Manipulation Enhancements in SQL Server 2022

SQL Server 2022 brings forth a suite of operators dedicated to bit manipulation, significantly easing operations such as bit masking, and bitwise AND, OR, NOT operations, along with shifting bits left or right. This feature can be particularly useful in scenarios where data compression or encoding is required. Below is a demonstration utilizing these new capabilities to encode color selections and pack numerical values into a single byte.

## Customer Table Creation and Population

First, a `Customer` table is created to hold customer information, color selections, and a pair of numerical values, each fitting within a byte:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
  CustomerId       int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  FirstName        varchar(50),
  LastName         varchar(50),
  ColorSelections  tinyint,      -- Pack eight single-bit values (0 or 1) in a single byte (0-255)
  MinMax           tinyint       -- Pack two four-bit values (0-15) in a single byte (0-255)
)

INSERT INTO Customer
  (FirstName,    LastName,     ColorSelections,  MinMax) VALUES
  ('Ken',        'Sanchez',                  0,       0),
  ('Terri',      'Duffy',                   18,      48),
  ('Roberto',    'Tamburello',              96,     126),
  ('Rob',        'Walters',                158,     158),
  ('Gail',       'Erickson',               255,     255)
```

## Bitwise Operations and Aggregations

The query demonstrates the extraction and manipulation of bits within the `ColorSelections` and `MinMax` columns:

```sql
SELECT
  FirstName,
  ColorSelections,
  CONVERT(binary(1), ColorSelections) AS ColorSelectionsHex,
  BIT_COUNT(ColorSelections) AS ColorCount,
  GET_BIT(ColorSelections, 7) AS Black,
  GET_BIT(ColorSelections, 6) AS Brown,
  GET_BIT(ColorSelections, 5) AS Purple,
  GET_BIT(ColorSelections, 4) AS Cyan,
  GET_BIT(ColorSelections, 3) AS Yellow,
  GET_BIT(ColorSelections, 2) AS Blue,
  GET_BIT(ColorSelections, 1) AS Green,
  GET_BIT(ColorSelections, 0) AS Red,
  MinMax,
  CONVERT(binary(1), MinMax) AS MinMaxHex,
  RIGHT_SHIFT(MinMax, 4) AS Min,
  MinMax & 0x0F AS Max
FROM
  Customer
```

In this example, `BIT_COUNT` returns the count of set bits (1s), and `GET_BIT` checks for specific bit positions within the byte. `RIGHT_SHIFT` and bitwise AND `&` operations are used to extract the 'min' and 'max' values encoded within a single byte.

## Cleanup

To cleanup, drop the Customer table:

```sql
DROP TABLE Customer
```
