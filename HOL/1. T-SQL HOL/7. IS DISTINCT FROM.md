## Understanding IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM in SQL Server 2022

SQL Server 2022 introduces `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM`, an enhancement in T-SQL syntax that simplifies comparisons, including handling NULL values in comparisons, which traditionally require additional logic.

### Part 1: Simplifying Comparisons Including NULLs

Traditionally, comparing values in SQL, especially when NULLs are involved, can be cumbersome and unintuitive. The standard `!=` or `=` operators do not include NULLs in their comparison, necessitating additional conditions for NULL handling.

Consider the setup and demonstration with the `Sample` table:

```sql
USE MyDB

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Sample

CREATE TABLE Sample (
    Id int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    Value int,
    Message nvarchar(50)
)

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IDX_Sample_Value ON Sample (Value)

INSERT INTO Sample VALUES 
 (NULL, 'hello'),
 (10, NULL),
 (17, 'abc'),
 (17, 'yes'),
 (NULL, NULL)
```

Standard comparisons might ignore or improperly handle NULLs:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Sample WHERE Value != 17                        -- Ignores NULLs
SELECT * FROM Sample WHERE Value != 17 OR Value IS NULL       -- Includes NULLs but requires additional condition
SELECT * FROM Sample WHERE Value != 17 OR Value = NULL        -- Using = with NULL doesn't work
```

`IS DISTINCT FROM` offers a more intuitive approach:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Sample WHERE Value IS DISTINCT FROM 17          -- Includes NULLs in comparison
```

### Part 2: Advanced Usage in Data Retrieval

In data retrieval scenarios, especially when dealing with optional or missing data (represented by NULLs), `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM` simplifies queries and makes them more readable.

For instance, in the `WideWorldImporters` database:

```sql
USE WideWorldImporters

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS Sales.Orders.IDX_Orders_PickingCompletedWhen

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IDX_Orders_PickingCompletedWhen ON Sales.Orders (PickingCompletedWhen)
```

Finding orders with specific picking completion statuses, including NULLs, becomes straightforward:

```sql
-- Find orders not completed
DECLARE @dt datetime2 = NULL

SELECT * FROM Sales.Orders
WHERE
    PickingCompletedWhen IS NOT DISTINCT FROM @dt
```

This approach eliminates the need for convoluted logic or functions like `ISNULL` to handle NULLs, streamlining queries and ensuring efficient use of indexes.

### Key Takeaways

- **NULL Handling:** `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM` seamlessly includes NULLs in comparisons, overcoming limitations of traditional operators.
- **Simplified Syntax:** Reduces the need for additional `OR` conditions or functions to specifically handle NULLs.
- **Efficiency:** Promotes better query plans and index usage, especially in comparison to approaches that might lead to index scans instead of seeks.

SQL Server 2022's `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM` represents a significant step forward in simplifying T-SQL queries, especially those involving NULL comparisons, enhancing both readability and performance.
