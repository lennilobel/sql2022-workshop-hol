### Enhanced STRING_SPLIT with Ordinal in SQL Server 2022

SQL Server 2022 enhances the `STRING_SPLIT` function by introducing an "enable ordinal" parameter. This improvement addresses a common challenge faced when splitting strings and needing to preserve the original order of elements, especially beneficial in scenarios involving data deduplication and bulk processing.

#### Basic Usage of STRING_SPLIT

**SQL Server 2016 and later:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM STRING_SPLIT('Bravo/Alpha/Tango/Delta', '/')
```

This example demonstrates the basic functionality available since SQL Server 2016, splitting a string into rows without preserving the order of elements.

**Enhancement in SQL Server 2022:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM STRING_SPLIT('Bravo/Alpha/Tango/Delta', '/', 1)
```

The introduction of the ordinal parameter allows for the preservation of element order, significantly enhancing the function's utility.

#### Deduplicating Items While Preserving Order

**Deduplication without preserving order:**

```sql
SELECT
    value,
    ordinal
FROM
    STRING_SPLIT('Bravo/Alpha/Bravo/Tango/Delta/Bravo/Alpha/Delta', '/', 1)
```

This query illustrates how the ordinal value can initially be used to view the order of elements.

**Preserving order during deduplication:**

```sql
SELECT
    value,
    ordinal = MIN(ordinal)
FROM 
    STRING_SPLIT('Bravo/Alpha/Bravo/Tango/Delta/Bravo/Alpha/Delta', '/', 1)
GROUP BY
    value
ORDER BY
    ordinal
```

By leveraging the `MIN(ordinal)` function in combination with `GROUP BY`, we can deduplicate the elements while maintaining their original sequence.

**Rebuilding the string with deduplication:**

```sql
WITH SplitCte AS (
    SELECT
        value,
        ordinal = MIN(ordinal)
    FROM
        STRING_SPLIT('Bravo/Alpha/Bravo/Tango/Delta/Bravo/Alpha/Delta', '/', 1)
    GROUP BY
        value
)
SELECT
    Deduped = STRING_AGG(value, '/') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ordinal)
FROM
    SplitCte
```

The `STRING_AGG` function is then used to reconstruct the string from the deduplicated elements, preserving their original order.

#### Bulk Processing with Preserved Ordinal

In a scenario requiring bulk processing of rows identified by IDs supplied as a CSV string, preserving the original order of IDs is crucial for correlating results.

**Example with AdventureWorks2019:**

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2019

-- Here are three person rows with IDs 6, 12, and 18
SELECT BusinessEntityID, FirstName
FROM Person.Person
WHERE BusinessEntityID IN (6, 12, 18)

-- Bulk processing with preserved order
DECLARE @BusinessEntityIDs varchar(max) = '6,12,18'

WITH BusinessEntityIDsCte AS (
    SELECT
        CONVERT(int, value) AS BusinessEntityID,
        ordinal
    FROM
        STRING_SPLIT(@BusinessEntityIDs, ',', 1)
)
SELECT
    ids.Ordinal,    -- Use ordinal for original sequence correlation
    p.FirstName,
    p.LastName,
    e.JobTitle
FROM
    Person.Person AS p
    INNER JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e ON e.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID
    INNER JOIN BusinessEntityIDsCte AS ids ON ids.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID
ORDER BY
    LastName
```

This comprehensive example underscores the utility of the enhanced `STRING_SPLIT` function in SQL Server 2022, facilitating accurate order preservation in string manipulation tasks.
