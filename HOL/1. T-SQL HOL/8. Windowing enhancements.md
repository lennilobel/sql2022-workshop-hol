## Creating Transaction Data for SQL Server Analysis

When learning SQL Server, particularly the enhancements in SQL Server 2022 related to windowing functions, it's beneficial to work with a sample dataset that demonstrates various transactions across multiple accounts. Below is a SQL script that creates a table named `TxnData` and populates it with transaction data for three different accounts. This dataset will be useful for exploring the use of window functions and their enhancements in SQL Server 2022.

```sql
CREATE TABLE TxnData (AcctId int, TxnDate date, Amount decimal);

INSERT INTO TxnData (AcctId, TxnDate, Amount) VALUES
  (1, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 10), 500),  -- 5 transactions for account 1
  (1, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 22), 250),
  (1, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 24), 75),
  (1, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 26), 125),
  (1, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 28), 175),
  (2, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 11), 500),  -- 8 transactions for account 2
  (2, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 15), 50),
  (2, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 22), 5000),
  (2, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 25), 550),
  (2, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 27), 105),
  (2, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 27), 95),
  (2, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 29), 100),
  (2, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 30), 2500),
  (3, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 14), 500),  -- 4 transactions for account 3
  (3, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 15), 600),
  (3, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 22), 25),
  (3, DATEFROMPARTS(2011, 8, 23), 125);
```

### Purpose of the Script:

- **Educational Foundation**: This script serves as an excellent foundation for practicing and understanding SQL commands, particularly for beginners or those new to SQL Server 2022's features.
- **Window Functions Analysis**: By analyzing transactions across different accounts and dates, users can learn how window functions operate over a set of rows, providing insights into running totals, moving averages, and other analytical operations.
- **Exploring SQL Server 2022 Enhancements**: The dataset is specifically designed to explore the enhancements in windowing functions introduced with SQL Server 2022, including the `WINDOW` clause for more readable and maintainable SQL queries.

Ensure your SQL Server instance is active, and you have the necessary permissions to create tables and insert data. This setup will enable you to proceed with more complex queries and analyses using the provided transaction data.

## Exploring Running and Sliding Aggregations in SQL Server with Note on Code Duplication

The following SQL query leverages window functions for conducting running and sliding aggregations on a dataset containing transaction information across different accounts. These operations are made possible by the `OVER` clause paired with `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` subclauses, facilitating the calculation of averages, counts, minimums, maximums, and sums relative to the rows in the specified window.

```sql
-- OVER with ORDER BY for aggregate functions (SQL 2012+) enables running/sliding aggregations

SELECT AcctId, TxnDate, Amount,
  RAvg = AVG(Amount) OVER (PARTITION BY AcctId ORDER BY TxnDate),
  RCnt = COUNT(*)    OVER (PARTITION BY AcctId ORDER BY TxnDate),
  RMin = MIN(Amount) OVER (PARTITION BY AcctId ORDER BY TxnDate),
  RMax = MAX(Amount) OVER (PARTITION BY AcctId ORDER BY TxnDate),
  RSum = SUM(Amount) OVER (PARTITION BY AcctId ORDER BY TxnDate),
  SAvg = AVG(Amount) OVER (PARTITION BY AcctId ORDER BY TxnDate ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),
  SCnt = COUNT(*)    OVER (PARTITION BY AcctId ORDER BY TxnDate ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),
  SMin = MIN(Amount) OVER (PARTITION BY AcctId ORDER BY TxnDate ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),
  SMax = MAX(Amount) OVER (PARTITION BY AcctId ORDER BY TxnDate ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),
  SSum = SUM(Amount) OVER (PARTITION BY AcctId ORDER BY TxnDate ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
FROM TxnData
ORDER BY AcctId, TxnDate
GO
```

### Significance of the R and S Prefix

- **Running Aggregations (R Prefix)**: Denote cumulative totals or averages up to the current row within each partition (account), providing insight into the evolving trends.
  
- **Sliding Aggregations (S Prefix)**: Apply to a fixed range of rows around the current row within each partition, offering a snapshot of trends over a specified interval.

### Note on Code Duplication

A notable aspect of this script is the duplication within the `OVER` clauses across multiple lines. Each aggregation function (`AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`) repeats the same `OVER` clause setup, specifying `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` for both running and sliding aggregations. This redundancy can lead to longer, less maintainable SQL scripts, particularly as the complexity of the windowing logic increases.

SQL Server 2022 addresses this challenge by introducing the `WINDOW` clause, allowing for the definition of reusable named window frames. This enhancement significantly reduces code duplication and improves both readability and maintainability by enabling the specification of common windowing elements (like partitioning and ordering criteria) in a single, centralized location within the query.

## Leveraging SQL Server 2022 WINDOW Clause for Enhanced Readability

SQL Server 2022 introduces the `WINDOW` clause to SQL queries, a significant enhancement for defining reusable window frames in windowing functions. This enhancement facilitates a cleaner and more maintainable approach for running and sliding aggregations, as demonstrated in the following examples.

### Query Using Single WINDOW Clause

```sql
SELECT AcctId, TxnDate, Amount,
  RAvg = AVG(Amount) OVER win,
  RCnt = COUNT(*)    OVER win,
  RMin = MIN(Amount) OVER win,
  RMax = MAX(Amount) OVER win,
  RSum = SUM(Amount) OVER win,
  SAvg = AVG(Amount) OVER (win ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),
  SCnt = COUNT(*)    OVER (win ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),
  SMin = MIN(Amount) OVER (win ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),
  SMax = MAX(Amount) OVER (win ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),
  SSum = SUM(Amount) OVER (win ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
FROM TxnData
WINDOW
  win AS (PARTITION BY AcctId ORDER BY TxnDate)
ORDER BY AcctId, TxnDate
```

In this query, a single `WINDOW` clause named `win` is defined to partition data by `AcctId` and order it by `TxnDate`, applicable to both running (R) and sliding (S) aggregations. This already reduces the repetition seen in pre-2022 versions, where each aggregation function required an explicit `OVER` clause. However, for sliding aggregations, the clause `(win ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)` is still repeated.

### Query with Enhanced WINDOW Clause Eliminating Code Duplication

```sql
SELECT AcctId, TxnDate, Amount,
  RAvg = AVG(Amount) OVER winRunning,
  RCnt = COUNT(*)    OVER winRunning,
  RMin = MIN(Amount) OVER winRunning,
  RMax = MAX(Amount) OVER winRunning,
  RSum = SUM(Amount) OVER winRunning,
  SAvg = AVG(Amount) OVER winSliding,
  SCnt = COUNT(*)    OVER winSliding,
  SMin = MIN(Amount) OVER winSliding,
  SMax = MAX(Amount) OVER winSliding,
  SSum = SUM(Amount) OVER winSliding
FROM TxnData
WINDOW
  winRunning AS (PARTITION BY AcctId ORDER BY TxnDate),
  winSliding AS (winRunning ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
ORDER BY AcctId, TxnDate
GO
```

This version further improves the query's readability and maintainability by defining two named `WINDOW` clauses: `winRunning` for running aggregations and `winSliding` for sliding aggregations based on `winRunning`. This approach entirely eliminates the need to repeat the `ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` clause for each sliding aggregation, showcasing the power of SQL Server 2022's `WINDOW` clause in enhancing code efficiency and clarity.

Through these examples, SQL Server 2022's `WINDOW` clause not only reduces the redundancy of window specifications in complex queries but also significantly improves their readability and maintainability.
